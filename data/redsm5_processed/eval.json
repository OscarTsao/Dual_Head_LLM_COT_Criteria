    "input_text": "[Long Story] My life of abuse in the foster care system with multi-revenge **Background** The story I want to tell you is full of sadness and heartache. I started out life in poverty living with my parents in a house that had some wooden floors and mostly dirt floors. My mother has a long list of mental issues and my father was an alcoholic and thankfully not the abusive type. Me and my sister were taken from our home when I was 7 and she was 4. We got placed into the foster care system in Kentucky. I'm not going to use real names, but I will use the initials of their names. It's my understanding at the time foster parents in Kentucky could have up to four kids per room and they didn't have a limit of how many a single foster parent could keep. Linda's home was a longhouse with six bedrooms and she was keeping at least eight kids at a time. In the foster care system it's not uncommon to see a child stay with us just for a week and then be released back to the family, so we had different kids come and go all the time. **The Foster Family** The foster home we went to was ran by a woman we'll call Linda and she was a widow. Her husband had passed away in the 80s. She had 4x sons and 1x daughter. Her youngest son we'll call Jay was still living with her because he had fallen from a truck when he was a kid and damaged his skull. This caused him to have a learning disability and he couldn't read or write and at the time of me living with them he was about 26 years old. Her other son Chase was the oldest and he was a plumber. Another son is Dean and he owned five large farms and ran a grocery store. The fourth son was Cody and he died in the 80s from being shot. Her only daughter was Sandy and she was very kind to us. **The Beginning** When we entered the foster care system it was a really scary time for us and I'll never forget the screams of our parents as they ripped us from our home. Because we didn't have running water and electricity the old barn converted into a house wasn't suitable for children according to our social worker. When I first arrived I had broken my wrist and had my arm in a cast. The first thing we did was go shopping for clothes as I didn't bring any with me. When we return from shopping I put my things away and was then given a trash bag and told to go outside and not come back in until all of the loose trash was picked up. Just to let you know now, this was more of a work camp instead of a loving and caring home. While I was picking up trash Jay was in the swimming pool they had beside the home. He yelled for me to come to him and he asked me if I wanted to swim. I told him I didn't know how to swim and I can't because of my obvious broken arm. He then grabbed me and tossed me into the pool and I screamed for help. I really felt like I was going to die that day. He took his time but jumped in and pulled me out. He told me to stop crying as if I would have drowned no one would have cared because I didn't matter. I remember his words like it was yesterday. When I finally got to bed that night I couldn't sleep and I cried the whole night missing my parents. Little did I know this was just the beginning of a hard 12 years of life to come. **Big Ben, Sexual Abuse and My First Revenge** When I first arrived I was told by Linda that another boy will be sharing my room with me and he was away at camp for the week. I arrived at her house when school was out for the summer. His real name wasn't Ben at all and we'll call him Ben. Ben had been in the home for a while and he was about to turn 18 and when you turn 18 the foster care system lets you go as you're an adult now. When he returned from camp he was a very large guy, and I'm guessing about 6'2 and 230+ pounds. When I first met him things seemed to be fine, but it was the first night of him being back that he tried to molest me. I have a hard time sleeping as it is because everyday I wanted to leave and be back with my parents. He got up from his bed that's on the other side of the room and then got into mine. He tried to force his penis into my mouth. He held my nose shut so that I couldn't breath and I had no choice but to open my mouth. As he did this I did bite him as it was the only thing I could think to do. He jumped off of me and smacked me so hard it knocked me out as I don't remember anything else. The next morning when I got up with my face hurting and my mouth busted I ran to tell Linda what he did to me. She took me into her bedroom to talk about it and I told her everything. When she confronted him about it he said I was trying to steal his money and he smacked me for it. I told her that's not true and he checked his wallet for his money and couldn't find it. He asked me for his money back and Linda searched my pockets. She pulled out $20 and she knew I had no money, she told me I was going to be punished and made me scrub the front porch. Ben had put his money in my pocket after he knocked me out and I have no idea what else might have happened to me during that time. That night I cried and was sitting by the bedroom door in fear of being hurt again. I did this for a few nights and didn't get any sleep hardly. I was falling asleep outside doing work and getting in trouble for it. One day I'm in my room playing with hot wheels another foster kid let me have. Ben walks in and closes the door and I just start screaming. He quickly jumps on me and covers my mouth and Linda is outside doing something and doesn't hear me. He tells me if I scream again he's going to smack me again and I'm only 7 with a broken arm, I really can't do anything. He spits into my mouth and makes me swallow it while he lays on top of me. I don't know what else would have happened to me because Linda came back inside and called for him to do something. This time I didn't lay and cry at all, I just laid in place thinking about what to do. I decide I'm not going to let him keep hurting me so I go to the kitchen and sneak a fillet knife into my room and I put it under my pillow. That night he get's up and jumps into my bed. He told me to remember what will happen if I scream or resist. I tell him I understand. I slip the knife from under the pillow and hid it under the covers. He then pushes me down to his penis again and that's when I let him have it. I slashed and cut him as many times as I could. He quickly disarms me and runs out of the room into the bathroom. I run to wake up Linda and I told her what happened and she called 911. She told me not to say a word to the cops about what happened and to go back to bed. Ben and Linda told the cops he had been sleep walking and he didn't mean to cut himself. She told me if I come out of my room and say anything the cops, they wouldn't believe me because I'm a lair. After this happened Ben never came back and I don't know what happened to him but I knew I wasn't going to ever let anyone do that to me again. A really shitty thing Linda did to me was force me to wash the bed and the carpet of all the blood from Ben. I had to scrub the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom as punishment. **Verbal Abuse, Slave Work and Sexual Abuse to Girls** Being told that you were worthless; didn't matter to anyone; you'll never be anything; was commonly said from Jay and Linda as they used that to demoralize the kids. They treated all of the foster kids this way and would tell us we are lucky to be living with them as this is the only way we wouldn't be in jail or dead. They told us if we ever left we would end up in and out of jail because we are just as worthless as our parents. Anytime any of the kids wanted to do any after school event or even play sports they would tell them they don't matter or will never be anything so why waste the time now. I was also threatened to be put into a boys home away from my sister if I ever told anyone about how Linda treated us. At a young age you don't know any better sadly and you're to scared to think otherwise. All of the boys worked the farms of Dean and we didn't get to bed until about 11PM. We got up every morning at 4AM to do farm work with feeding cows, chickens and pigs. After we finished our work in the morning we had to quickly scramble to get cleaned up for school as the bus arrived at 6:20ish AM every day. You never had time to do any school work after you got home because you had to eat and then get back outside. It made passing classes in school really hard because I only had the bus ride home to get my homework done. Dean had lots of tobacco farms and as you can image he was doing really well for himself because he had free labor all year long. Raising tobacco isn't an easy job by any means and it's even harder when your just a kid. This kind of life went on for the whole time I was at the home and nothing ever got better. Remember that this foster home keeps boys and girls from all walks of life. Also remember that Linda's 20 something son Jay lives with her as well. One night I was up going to the bathroom when I could hear faint crying. The crying was coming from the girls room and I went to find out what was wrong. I opened the door to find Jay having sex with a girl that was about 16 years old or so. I ran to tell Linda and he quickly ran out of the room after me. All of the noise woke Linda up and Jay told her the caught me sneaking into the girls room. At this point I'm about ten years old or so and I try to explain to her what happened. She told me I'm telling lies and I should be ashamed of myself. She told me Jay would never do such a thing and I was in serious trouble tomorrow. I talked with the girl on the school bus the next morning and she said it was her idea to have sex. She told me she had been flirting with him and she was hungry for sex. I told her I was going to tell the social workers and she said if I did she would claim it never happened. When I did get home I was punished to clean out this old crappy garbage bin they have behind the home and it was full of loose garbage from bags getting ripped. The garbage bin was built of wood pallets and it was really large. They refused to give me any gloves to pick up the trash and as you might know, trash normally has food in it too. Of course all of this is rotten and full of maggots. It took me about six hours to clean it out. Later that week when we went to the social workers office for our visitation with my parents I told the social worker what happened to the girl and she pulled me into a private room to talk about it. I told her everything that was happening and she told me she'll stop by tomorrow after we get home from school for a surprise visit. What I found out later in life is that the social workers in my county hated conflict and paperwork, so they would always give the foster homes a heads up on visits. The next day when we arrived home her car was sitting in our driveway. When I walked in she took the girl out to her car to have a talk. While the social worker was away Linda tells me she knows what I've done and I'm going to wish I had never opened my mouth. The social worker comes back with the girl and sits in the living room with Linda, Jay, me and all of the other foster kids. She goes on to tell us the importance of telling the truth and makes an example out of me. She told the other kids not to tell lies like I do as it causes unneeded stress and issues for everyone. After she left Linda told me she's going to make me pay for this and it might not be today but one day (remember this phrase). **Getting Adopted and Physical Abuse** When I turned 16 I had been in the foster care system for about 8 years and my parents finally signed us over to the state. My social worker told me she's going to place us in line to be adopted and we will be visiting with new parents in the following weeks. I was very heart broken but I was also excited as I couldn't wait to get away from Linda and her family. Weeks go by and we never get to visit anyone and I started to get worried. One day Linda comes to school to pick us up and tells us we are getting adopted today! I was really confused because we hadn't meet with anyone. We arrive at the social workers office and go in with Linda. We go into a room where my parents are and paperwork is on the table. Because I was 16 I had to sign paperwork stating that I understood what was going on. The social worker tells me Linda is going to adopt us and I start crying on the spot. I tell them I would rather be dead then to be adopted by her and the social worker told me she understands my anger because I hate to obey rules. She was convinced that I was hating Linda because I was a rebel and the normal teenager who hated following rules at this age. I told her that's not true and she said she knows it to be true and she doesn't want to hear me tell any more lies. My parents are both crying and they have already signed the paperwork weeks ago. Linda signs hers and I refused to sign mine. The social worker told me if I don't sign it, it doesn't change anything as I'll still be adopted by Linda. On the way home from the social workers office Linda looks up in the mirror and gives me a long gaze that I'll never forget. She then says, \"I told you one day you'll pay for what you've done and that day has arrived.\" I felt chills run down my spine and I was really in complete shock. Even as I type this out now I still get that same chill running down my spine and I can see her eye's glaring at me in the mirror. Now that she adopted me and my sister we were no longer protected by the foster care system. With foster kids, you're not allowed to lay a hand on them to discipline them and now that we are adopted that's out the window. Now, more abuse starts that we never had before. Now when Linda gets mad she would throw things at me, hit me with coffee cups, remote controls, chairs or anything else she could get her hands on. Jay then began to beat me like I was a man when I talked back to him or not doing what he said the second he said it. At this point I felt broken and alone. My sister was treated like a princess and it's because she arrived at the home when she was 4, so she only knows Linda as her only parent and always did what she commanded. My sister at the time had no real understanding of who Linda was and how awful her family was. My sister was over the moon about being adopted and having Linda's last name. My sister was basically brainwashed into thinking Linda could do no wrong and that I was just a troublemaker. I felt like I had lost the only family I had, she was my everything and I sacrificed so much because I never wanted to be separated from her. **My Father Passed Away** My grand plan in life was to turn 18 and go live with my parents away from Linda and her family. It wasn't long after I was adopted that my father was diagnosed with cancer in his throat. I was crushed by this news as my father was my hero. I was only with my parents until the age of 7, but they truly loved us and provided for us the best they could. My parents had never raised a hand to us growing up and treated us with the love kids need. My sister and I had monthly visits with our parents while in foster care and never missed any of them. We would get dropped off at the social workers office where our parents would walk with us to the local park and play. They didn't have a car or anything and used a local program for people in poverty to get access to transpiration. We had a local program ran by the county that would pick people up and drive them to the grocery store, doctor visits, and court. It was like Uber but it was limited as to where they would take you and how often. My uncle is helping my parents the most that he can and he takes my father for all of this chemo treatments. He is also coming to Linda's to pick us up to go and see my parents. At this point we're doing home visits with my parents as it's not easy for my father to travel. My father has been fighting with cancer for little over a year at this point. One day we are home for a visit with my father and he's in really bad shape. While he was gone for a chemo treatment someone broke into his house and stole all of his pain medication. My uncle tried to get the medication refilled and was turned away because they didn't have a police report. My father knew who stole the pills and didn't want to turn him in as cops to poor people is the enemy. I was in art class and was called to the front office to take a call. My uncle had called to tell me my father tried to commit suicide and he's being transported to the hospital. He told me he was on his way to pick me and my sister up to go see him. My father lasted a few days and passed away from his liver shutting down. I was able to see him before he died and he could squeeze my hand to let me know he could understand me. I made sure to tell him how much I loved him and I promise to make him proud. I'm telling this part of the story because of how Linda and her family treated me afterwards. They told me that deadbeats like my father are lazy people who draw a check every month paid for by working people. They said it's a good thing he's dead and now my mother needs to drop dead as she draws a check too. They told me this on the way home from the hospital! I sit in the main back of the van in silence and not shedding a tear. I was no longer going to let them control me and keep me down. I made a promise to myself that I will do everything in my power to be better than them and one day I would show them what my pain feels like. My father passed away on October 25th, 12x days before I would turn 18 on Nov 7th. My mother was soon after awarded to the state and placed into a nursing home due to her mental issues. **Making It on My Own** The day after we put my father to rest I started working with my uncle painting barns and sealing driveways. When I lived with my parents I missed to much school when I was in the first grade and failed. So getting out of high school I would be 19 years old. I had plans to go to Houston TX and learn underwater welding as that's where the money was. My uncle was paying me even on days we didn't find any work to make sure I had enough money to make it on my own. I had saved up about $1,200 and graduated high school. My uncle had paid a driver to take me and Linda down to TX. Linda had to go with me because I under the age of 25 and she had to sign paperwork stating she wouldn't be helping me with any student loans. We set out for TX and we are driving her van as my uncle's truck had broken down the day before and he only had his huge work truck that wouldn't be feasible to take. We get about 4 hours into the trip and Linda is getting frustrated. She told us she's tired of being in the van and she no longer wants to do this. She orders the driver to pull over in the next city. He does as she says because it's her van and she kicks me out onto a sidewalk. I have a bag of cloths and $1,200 in my pocket. They then take off and I watch them drive away and I keep watching for a few moments to make sure they are not coming back. I felt a relief sensation rush over my body, I'm free! I'm finally free! Of course this isn't where I wanted to be at as 4 hours south of Kentucky isn't TX at all. I picked up my bag and walked up the sidewalk and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do. I could get a bus ticket and make my way down to TX but I don't have the first idea where a bus station is. Please understand that I had never been outside of my home town before this. I had never even met a person of any other race before. All I've ever done was go to school and work on a farm. I had no real education and hardly made it out of school. I come across a school in a shopping center and I decided to check it out. The school isn't even around today and was shut down because it a for profit school that gave you no value, and of course I had no idea at the time. I walk in and talk with the front desk about getting info on the school. She sends me to talk with a lady in admissions and I explain to her my situation. She tells me how I can get funding to go here and how she can get my housing tonight. They had a school housing program where they would put four students in a two bedroom apartment. She had me forge Linda's signature on paper work about financial aid. I go to this two year college and get a Associates Degree in Computer Science. I start working for a major computer company right out of college. I save every dime I can and only spend money when I need to. I buy my first truck with cash a year after starting at my job. **My Second Revenge** I was still keeping tabs on my sister back in Kentucky. At this point my sister is about to get married and I'm going to walk her down the aisle at the church Linda always took us to growing up. Please understand that Linda is a big figure at her church and well respected, this is important to understand for later. I drive up the weekend of the wedding and get a hotel room about an hour outside of where we grew up. My sister's best friend in the world and that's even true today calls me and we'll call her Karia. She tells me that my sister's fiance is abusive to her and she wants to call the wedding off but Linda told her she couldn't and not to embarrass her at the church. Linda knows that he's abusive to my sister and has told her she needs to obey him as he will be her husband. On the day of the wedding I walk my sister down the aisle like normal. The pastor does his thing and says some words and what not then comes the part where he asks if anyone thinks they shouldn't be married they must speak now. This is where I stand up and say, \"I object to my sister being married to an abusive drunk.\" You could hear a pin drop for a moment and Linda's face is blood red. I then go on to say how Linda had know about the abuse and told my sister she was going to get married no matter what and not to \"embarrass her\" here today. Linda then loudly exclaims that I'm a known liar and everyone knows they can't believe a word I say. The pastor at this point asks me to please leave and my sister spoke up for me. Telling everyone that what I had said was the truth and we ran out of the church together. Linda was later removed from the church management and asked to please not come back to the church as they don't believe in abuse (I know what you're thinking). Oh man, I wish I could have been in the pastor's office to hear this conversation and to see the look on her face. After all of this happened my sister moved in with Karia where she would later meet her husband. **The Final Revenge** It had been about 7 years now from the wedding crash. I'm now married and I have a house of my own and living a great life. My sister had married a real man who treats her right and they have a great little girl together. Karia is now working at the county courthouse and does a lot of work with properties and taxes. She calls me one day to tell me Linda's property tax is way behind and they didn't get the tax lien lifted and now they will have a tax deed sale of the property. I knew this was my time to strike and pay them back for a fraction of the pain they had caused me. I show up at the auction and the only other person to show up was Jay and his wife. When he noticed me he turned pale and then tried to be all buddy buddy with me. I was very friendly and he asked me why I'm here. I tell him it's to help keep the property in the family and I had no problem helping out. I let him know if I get ownership I'll pay the taxes for them so they won't need to worry about this being a problem again ever again. His brother Dean had given him the money needed to purchase the property back so he had cash with him to pay for the taxes and fees. I told him to keep the cash and let them know you took care of the taxes. So the bidding starts at a little over $2,000 because of the back due taxes and fees. I bid on it and Jay doesn't. I easily win and now have instant ownership of the propriety. I go down the the courthouse with Jay and I finish all of the paper work with Karia. Linda had fallen behind on the property taxes because she was giving the money to Jay to pay it. Well it turns out Jay is what we call a \"pill head\" and was using the money to buy drugs. Linda didn't keep foster kids anymore because of her age she wasn't allowed to so they didn't have any money coming in besides disability and SSI. When I arrived to the house I told Linda how I regret being a horrible child and now that I'm older I've grown out of it. I let her know how much of a mother she was to me when I didn't have one and that I was here to pay her back. I told her now that I own the property she'll never need to worry about property taxes ever again. I let her know I'm going to remodel her house but she can't live in it at the same time. I told her this works out, because I won the bid the county would automatically evict them. Linda is a person who thinks we've never been to the moon, so tricking her into believing me was easy. She told me she could stay at Dean's house while I'm remodeling hers and she was very excited. I told her not to worry about any of the belongs they have as I'll make sure they are covered up and moved when needed. I tell her a lawyer will be sending some paperwork over to her in a few days. I then hire a lawyer to do an ejectment of Linda and Jay from the property. I don't know if I could have done this a different way, but this was the advice I was given at the time. It took about two months for everything to be fully mine and them evicted. With them evicted and now that all the belongs have stayed in the house past 30 days, I now own all of it. I got in contact with the local fire department to find out what I needed to do in order to burn a house down on my property. They informed me that it has to be a controlled burn, I'll need a permit to close off the road as the home sits near a public road and I had to have the water shut off and the power disconnected. The water was easy but it took awhile for the power because they had to remove all the wires running to the pole and remove the transformer. The fire department gave me a date and time I was allowed to do the burning and I coordinated with the sheriffs office to close the road. I got my permit from the city and now I just had to sit and wait. The day of the great fire, I prep the house with lots of straw inside and I made sure to take all of the doors down and open all of the windows as I wanted this to burn as fast as possible. I go to Dean's house to visit Jay and Linda. I told them I wanted to take them out by the old oak tree for lunch. This tree was in a field across the road from the home. When we worked on the farm we would eat lunch in the summer under the shade of this tree. Linda is in a wheelchair and Jay has a bad back so he doesn't move around too well and almost needs a wheelchair. Drop them off and I tell them to enjoy the snacks and I'll be right back as I'm going to set fire to the old stuff I ripped out of the house. It's really common for people where we live to burn trash. I called the fire department to let them know I was going to start the fire and made sure they had the address. I met with the officers closing the road off let them know I was about to begin and they might encounter some family members trying to get by them and not to let them. I then went behind and started fires from under the house with packed straw. I'm standing beside them while they eat and chat with me about life and what I've been doing with my career. It's not too long before the fire starts to peek around the sides of the home. They start screaming about the fire and we need to call 911. This is when I told them I had the road closed and the fire department already knew that I was going to burn my house down on my property. I told them what they are seeing is just a fraction of the pain they had caused me over the course of my life and I want them to know what a fraction of my pain feels like as I could never fully make them understand. At this point Jay is trying to call his brothers and I reminded him I have the road closed and they can't get by. It takes less than 20 minutes for the house to collapse into a heap of junk. The whole time I'm watching them as they sit and sob. Jay tries to fight me and I would just move away from him as he's high and can't really move well anyway. About 30 minutes as passed and the fire gone with just smoke and embers glowing. I get in my car and drive back home knowing that they have now lost almost everything they have. They didn't lose has much as I have, but it was the closest thing to it. **Closing** Linda passed away in 2010 and Jay lives with this wife in an old trailer somewhere. I still own the property today and refuse to sell it to anyone because I don't want them to ever have the chance of owning the property again. I go back every year to check on the property to make sure they haven't moved a trailer on it or something on my land. From my understanding the property was in the family for more than 100 years. I haven't talked to any of them and never plan to. What I want is anyone reading this to take away that abuse is never ok, EVER! If you're being abused do not listen to the people abusing you. They will lie and put you down to hold control over you. If you can help anyone that you know that's being abused please, please help them get help. I hope this story can help someone else and just so you know I don't wish death or harm to Linda's family. Yes they were in the wrong for how they treated me and other kids, but I've learned you can't control the past but you can have influence on your future.",

    "input_text": "For as long as I can remember, I have always been this way. When I was a child I'd feel depressed, anxious, jealous, lonely and casted out all the time. I'm not a girl so I never cried out loud. But I have always been conflicted on the inside. I have always felt that I'm worthless, that nobody wants me. And I was not wrong. Nobody in this world loves me and respects. My classmates always humiliated me in front of everyone. Nobody would confess they had a relation with me because it would destroy their reputation. Wherever I go, It's always the same story. Even after 20 years, nothing has changed. My only true friends have never been loyal to me and they all left me. Adults never took me seriously. Even strangers on the internet don't think I deserve respect. There is something about me. Something like a shadow that follows me everywhere I go. Something I cannot even find it, let alone change it.",

    "input_text": "I truly understand this. I share many similarities with you. I grew up as the star kid, very talkative and joyful and hyper. I was always making people laugh and many people have commented on my humor my whole life. The last few years I have become a shell of that person. I used to love social gatherings and people. Now I get scared and anxious to talk on the phone with my best friend or to even hang out with family. I only feel comfortable around my parents and sister now. I put on a mask when I go out even though im trembling inside and act fine. As soon as I am alone im back to being depressed and unmotivated. I also turned somewhat pessimistic and time went on. I can only really see the issues with life and when I try to remind myself of the positive it never outweighs the bad. I have insomnia and anxiety as well and may even have hypomania. A few weeks ago I was optimistic, energized and doing things. And then I crashed and have been in what feels like a never ending depressive episode since June. I have been dealing with depression on and off since I was in middle school. I hate myself and dont ever remember a time where I liked myself even when things felt fine. I am also a university student and have no idea what I will do as school is starting back up in a week and I am battling everyday just to stay alive and stay sane. Overall, I feel you and you are not alone",

    "input_text": "You Don't Do That To Family Grandma started to lose her mind as she aged, and Mother thought it would be wise to take her into our home. She thought it might slow the progression, or at least keep her comfortable until her mind was emptied of every last one of it's marbles. Grandma was always a strict, bitter, and admittedly terrifying woman. She was well respected, but also feared. No one dared stand up to her, even as she started insisting that her delusions and hallucinations were true. We went along with it, but we also anxiously awaited the day that the 90 year old would pass. Myself being nearly twenty five meant that I did the majority of the housework to pay my dues, and Grandma was strict about it. Dad's been gone my entire life, I had no other siblings, and an ectopic pregnancy ruined my chances at having my own family and tore apart my fragile relationship. These two women are all I've got, and I needed them when I was alone and my mind slunk into dark places. Living with my mother wasn't the most desirable thing, but since my loss I haven't been able to function at 100%. Mom could use the help anyways, living alone can be depressing. I had been back home for a month when Grandma had come to stay with us. She wasn't quite as crazy when she first got there, just constantly mumbling about voices. I wasn't ecstatic about housing and caring for a mad woman, but I figured it could be worse. I thought it would be something else to take my mind off of constant dark thoughts, but she ended up being a black hole. After a few weeks of staying with us her condition was becoming noticeably worse. Her mumbling turned to shouting, and she began insisting the things she saw and heard were real. We had to play along or risk facing a violent outburst. She'd throw anything close enough to grab, and it fucking hurt if you were in the way of whatever she was throwing. We were nearly two months into this hell when she got my mother across the chest with a plate. It cut her deeply, and she had to go to the hospital for stitches. Grandma had always been a bitter woman, but this illness was bringing it to new levels. Mom refused to tell anyone outside the family how she really got the injury, and you could tell the secret was eating her up inside. She followed the one most important rule: You don't do that to family. Which meant, you *never* admit to someone outside the family that someone inside did something wrong. It was a rule that had been heavily enforced for generations. After that incident the situation in the house got very tense, and it made me wish I could get my shit together enough to leave. I'd feel awful leaving my mother alone with Grandma though. Another month and things were intolerable. The house was a constant cascade of noises, TVs, radios, and loud uncomfortable voices filled any silence. Silence was no longer allowed. Partaking in the delusions meant more than just patting the old woman on the shoulder and saying, Yes, I hear it too. We had to help her block out the voices, or face her wrath. I honestly couldn't understand why my mother wouldn't just put her in a home. I'd asked her, and every time she gave the same reply, You don't do that to family. I can understand the sentiment, I couldn't imagine how I'd feel if I had a child who sent me away to die in a false paradise. Old age homes are depressing, I've never met someone with any happy stories about sending a family member to one. Now, Grandma would be a different case. She didn't really deserve the amount of kindness we afforded her, but it wasn't entirely her fault. Sure she was a bitch before she went crazy, but it wasn't nearly as bad. The constant noise was enough to drive you up the wall, and I ended up finally using my prescription for sleeping pills. Along with the antidepressants I'd already been taking they helped enough to bring living there to a level only slightly below intolerable. It was okay, at least I could sleep through the noise. Mom didn't get the luxury of taking pills to shut it out, though she tried. The sleeping pills didn't work well enough for her, and the blaring radio coming from Grandma's room kept her up nearly every night. I think her true breaking point was about a month and a half ago. We were sitting down for dinner together, both the tv and radio were screaming the news from the living room. I could tell she was agitated, but I didn't realize how much until she got up and unplugged everything. The house fell into a moment of silence before Grandma started screaming. Laura, Laura! Why are you letting them take me! * She shrieked, grasping her head in both hands. After another quiet moment she looked to me instead, Mary, sweet child, don't let her do this to me. God, make it stop! * MAKE IT STOP!* I recoiled as her voice raised, unsure of what to do. Grandma it's okay, please--\nShut the *fuck* up. Is it so hard to just have a minute of quiet? My mother cut me off with a glare. I was shocked, to say the least. I didn't understand why she was suddenly and so aggressively deciding to stop playing into Grandma's delusions. I didn't have time to ask her either, because that was the moment when a butter knife flew across the table. The heavy metal handle her hit her just above her temple, and the blood was immediate. She was pissed, but in a terrifyingly calm way. She touched her fingers to the wound, looked at the blood, and smiled. You fucking *bitch,* She said in a low voice, I care for you, take you into my home, put up with your bullshit, and when we don't play along for thirty seconds you hurt us? Grandma looked a little shocked but resumed her yelling, They're going to take me, they took my baby! Look how she disobeys me, she's handing me to the voices! Mother shook her head and walked away from the table, and I did the only thing I thought would help. I started a random conversation with Grandma, something to distract her from her screaming and give my mom a chance to calm down and relax. It wasn't very helpful, I wasn't loud enough to block out the false voices in Grandma's head. I ended up sitting her in front of the TV and putting the news back on at a disgustingly loud volume. I went to find my mom and ask her if she was okay. She was in the bathroom tending to her wound. Are you going to the hospital? Did you really turn that damn TV back on? She replied without looking at me. Um.. Yea. I figured it was better than the screaming..\nI'm not going anywhere, someone will wonder why I've needed stitches twice in as many months. We don't talk about this kind of thing with other people. You don't do that to family. Oh, and stop making noise. I have a migraine and I'm going to lose it on someone if I hear another sound for the rest of the day. She pushed past me and walked away, leaving me conflicted. I spent the rest of the day trying to deal with the screaming, and when I could no longer take it I decided I needed to calm Grandma down. Mom had gotten so pissed off that she had moved the TV and radio from the living room into her own bedroom and closed herself in with them. There was only screaming to be heard in the house. I spent hours trying to talk Grandma out of it, but it only calmed her slightly. When mom finally came out of the room she looked exhausted. Didn't I tell you to shut up? She sighed. I felt bad for disobeying, but I didn't know how else to deal with it. You want tea Mary? Im gonna make us all some tea so we can forget about this stressful day. I nodded, wanting to avoid her freaking out again. We all sat and drank the tea, while Mom sang loudly to avoid the screaming. It was almost a peaceful moment. I checked the time after we finished and it was getting late, so I helped Grandma up the stairs and into bed. I turned on her bedside radio, and she was asleep within a few minutes. Relative peace at last. The day had exhausted me. I called a goodnight down the stairs to mom, and went into my own room. I couldn't immediately find my sleeping pills, but I was so exhausted that I didn't bother searching. I'd sleep fine without taking one. I slept better than I had in months, it was deep and peaceful and when I finally woke up I wished I could have stayed asleep forever. It was still dark, I was groggy and in a great amount of pain. I brought my hand to my face and I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I ran to the bathroom and caught sight of myself in the mirror, and my mouth bled as it attempted to open and vomit. I choked it down and cried silent tears. My mouth was sewn shut. Somehow through my shock I noticed an empty pill bottle in the sink, my sleeping pills. I had refilled the prescription only two days ago, meaning that nearly thirty pills had been used. I felt sick as I realized what my mother had done. I ran to Grandma's room next, and found her in the same mutilated state as I was. Only, she was also cold to the touch. I fought the urge to vomit again, and left the room. She either overdosed or asphyxiated and I wasn't trained to tell which was the case with her mouth sewn. I couldn't find my mother anywhere in the house, and when I pulled out my phone I realized that she could be anywhere right now. I had slept for nearly two days. No wonder I didn't wake up while being mutilated, I was nearly comatose. I wanted to call the police, but as I was about to dial I kicked myself internally. * You can't talk, stupid.* I walked my sorry ass to the nearest hospital, not wanting to traumatize anyone on the way. My car was missing, so I guess that's what mom used. The hospital staff nearly shit themselves when I walked into the emergency room, it was *almost* funny. This entire part if my journey is fairly boring, except for when they realized that behind my sewn lips I had no tongue. They replaced it, but I haven't learned how to speak again yet. I'm scared to talk ever again. The police came to question me about what happened, but I only wrote down that I couldn't remember. Obviously my mother was a suspect, they had found Grandma's body in her house. I know it seems messed up that I wouldn't directly admit what my mother did, but I have three very good reasons for that. She was already the only suspect. I was afraid she'd find me and punish me again for speaking when I shouldn't. You don't do that to family. [HF](<URL>)",

Over 50,000 police and 7,000 soldiers backed by rapid response units patrolled streets three days after a suspected Islamist gunman shot dead a policeman and wounded two others in the heart of the capital, Paris. Voters will decide whether to back a pro-EU centrist newcomer, a scandal-ridden veteran conservative who wants to slash public expenditure, a far-left eurosceptic admirer of Fidel Castro, or a far-right nationalist who, as France's first woman president, would shut borders and ditch the euro. The outcome will show whether the populist tide that saw Britain vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump elected president of the United States is still rising, or starting to ebb. But it also provides a choice between radically different recipes for reviving a listless economy that lags its neighbors, and where almost a quarter of under-25s have no job. A high level of indecision added to the nervousness. Hanan Fanidi, a 33-year-old financial project manager, was still unsure as she arrived at a polling station in Paris's 18th arrondissement. \"I don't believe in anyone, actually. I haven't arrived at any candidate in particular who could advance things,\" she said. \" I'm very, very pessimistic.\" Despite fears that broad disillusionment with politics could keep voters away, the early turnout, in fair weather nationwide, was marginally up on the last election, in 2012. Emmanuel Macron, 39, a centrist ex-banker who set up his party just a year ago, is the opinion polls' favorite to win the first round and then beat far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the two-person runoff on May 7.",

    "input_text": "I'm not commenting so much on sex as I am on finding an intimate relationship. Sure, sex is probably overrated, but I don't want a relationship solely for sex. To get someone of the opposite sex to want to be intimate with you is one of THE most important traits of being viewed as a functional person. People couldn't give two shits if you think you're alright for not having ever had an intimate relationship as it implies that there's something wrong with you, and people don't like that; they don't like someone like that hanging around them. If you are just looking to get your dick wet, it shouldn't be that difficult, but will still require effort. Make sure you present yourself hygienically, lower your standards and go to a gathering of similarly aged people and start talking to women, not just the stereotypically pretty or cute ones. Talk to everyone. If women see you blowing off the less attractive, plain ones...and then see you only chatting up the attractive ones, you're gonna be seen as an asshole. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, big fella: Ugly people, like normal/good looking people, don't like other ugly people. Just because someone's physically unattractive, doesn't mean they're going to be attracted to similarly unattractive people, and unlike said normal-looking people, I don't subscribe to the vitriolic delusions they feed themselves about 'loving someone for their personality'.*(Top fucking kek.)* I know a homely girl isn't going to be attracted to me and she knows I'm not going to be attracted to her. That's just how it is. I subject myself to nature, and nature is cruelly just. The reality of the situation is that there must be someone to fill in the opposite end of the bell curve regarding intimacy and those people are, generally, physically unattractive (disregarding the disabled/deformed). I am one such person, and no amount of \"talk to everyone\" will fix the fact that the sperm that happened to develop into me also carried certain genes that lead to facial unattractiveness/shortness. It's not my fault, it's not your fault, it's not anyone's fault--it's just how things are. In the worst case scenario, I accept my painful fate of isolation and loneliness with grim determination.

    "input_text": "30 years ago today, my neighbor's son disappeared. 30 years ago, my neighbors across the street, Mr. and Mrs. Stein, endured a terrible loss. Their son, Adam, disappeared on Halloween. It was assumed he was kidnapped, as there was a rash of kidnappings in the area at the time. The kidnapper was never found, though. Neither was Adam. Todays the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. To the Steins, the wounds are still fresh. They refuse to decorate their yard, despite all the houses on the street going out of their way to be as festive as possible. They dont give out candy, despite the rest of the houses on the street trying to one-up each other by giving out better loot than their neighbors. The Steins mourn quietly in their dark house; the television being the only light emanating from their window. Kids are advised by their parents not to knock. Ive always felt bad for them. Ive lived here for 40 years. I remember the frantic search and rescue efforts that swept through our town. Even though I was barely 20 years old and living with my unemployed father while working double shifts to pay our mortgage, I did my part and joined the search. It was the least I could do. Like all futile searches, it ended after a while. Adam was presumed dead. The Steins grew old and the neighborhood changed around us. New families moved in and old ones either died off or moved out. Aside from me and the Steins, Id say the average age of the homeowners here is 35. And they all have lots of kids. A terrible rumor started to spread a couple years ago. I know who started it - an older kid named Chuck Demopoulos. He told his younger brothers and neighborhood friends that Adams ghost haunts the woods behind our street. He said Mr. Stein killed him and chopped him up into little bits. When I learned about the rumor, I was disgusted. The disrespect was so vulgar and uncalled for. I prayed the Steins wouldnt hear about it, but Im sure they must have. It was pervasive. I called Chucks father and told him what I heard, and I suspect Chuck caught a beating for it. Still, Im afraid the damage had already been done. Despite pitying the Steins, I dont express my sympathy by refusing to decorate my house and yard. I love Halloween. Always have. I like to see parents beaming from the street while their kids nervously ring doorbells and collect piles of candy. The spirit of the season keeps me feeling young, despite being well past my prime and having to deal with high blood-pressure. Being an old timer has its perks sometimes. I have Halloween decorations they dont sell anymore. Ghoulish stuff like hangmans nooses - things that are too politically incorrect for stores to sell. I firmly believe Halloween shouldnt be sanitized. It should be scary and unsettling. That said, there needs to be an emotional component, too. Not just blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts. There needs to be poignancy. Something thatll stick with you after you see it. Thats why Adam helps me decorate. After Dad died in 1989, I emptied out his safety deposit box. There was an envelope with note a note and a Polaroid photograph. All the note said was, I caught him snooping around the cellar. I had to teach him a lesson. The photograph was of fresh cement drying on the basement wall. In the middle of the night, I went into the cellar and opened the wall. Adams body was inside. My instinctive reaction was to call the police, but I was terrified Id be arrested. Theyd never believe the note. So I sealed the wall. After a while, I stopped thinking about the dead boy in the bowels of my house. Many years later, after talking with Mrs. Stein about Adam on a Halloween afternoon, I knew what I had to do. I took his remains out of the wall in 2014. He was only a skeleton. I separated the bones, splashed them with fake blood, and incorporated them into my Halloween decorations. At first, I was worried. As the days went by, though, I realized I didnt need to be concerned. The bones blended in with the rest of my decorations. Just more festive material in a neighborhood chock full of it. This morning, when I went out to get the paper, Mr. Stein was doing the same. We met in the street and chatted for a while. We talked about the Cowboys game from last night and he mentioned his wife made a spectacular coffee cake that hed bring me a piece of later. I smiled and told him that would be real nice. Before we parted ways, Mr. Stein said, I never told you how much Shannon and I appreciated all the help you gave us back when we lost Adam. We knew how busy you were. Its been 30 years today, you know. I felt guilt and sadness wash over me. Im sure hes in a better place, I told him. He nodded, and I saw tears in his eyes. He was a good boy. I know wherever he is, hes watching over us. We hugged briefly, then went back to our respective homes. I walked up the driveway, past the ghosts dangling from my trees by their nooses, and headed up my front steps. I looked at the skull hanging above the doorway. It was pointed at the Steins house.

But the more I think about it the more frustrated I get knowing how helpless I was, completely at the mercy of whatever the fuck life decided to hit me with. It just doesnt make any sense. Do things happen for a reason? Or is it more so shit happens? If its the former I can kinda find hope and motivation feeling like I matter and my life has a purpose. If its the ladder I just feel pissed off, it makes me feel like nothing matters. I need an answer, not knowing which it is leads to indecision and procrastination. Either way I just want to make up for lost time starting now, I want to take full ownership of my life. I dont want to accept that I cant do anything at any stage in life.",

I stumbled upon this subreddit after browsing Reddit for a place where I could gain advice about my particular problem, and this seemed like a great place. So, I'll cut right to the chase - I have been obese for nearly my entire life. I won't get into specifics, but I am currently nearly 80 pounds overweight. I am embarrassed and ashamed of how far I have allowed my weight gain to progress. I've tried quite a few different tactics, but I have a difficult time sticking to any fitness routine for more than a couple of weeks due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and hypersomnia. I recognize that the constant exhaustion has likely developed as a result of the weight gain itself, but it's so difficult for me to convince myself that I should take a brisk walk when I can hardly get through the day without sleeping for 12-14 hours at night. I've come to rely on (prescribed) stimulants and caffeine, but even those are only a band-aid on this constant feeling of lethargy and tiredness. So, how do I develop a routine that I can actually stick to? Where do I start? There's something inside of me that yearns to wake up early every morning, enjoy the sunrise, exercise my body, and make it through the day without collapsing in exhaustion, but I feel so far away from that reality. I'm tired of using my fatigue as an excuse, but it often feels impossible to overcome.",

    "input_text": "That is a really tough issue. In my current relationship everything works out because I'm not totally opposed to sex, and we're also poly so my partner is free to have sex with someone else if he wants. But we aren't married and don't have any kids, so I can't give you any perspective there. What I can tell you is that you shouldn't feel horrible or that you're a freak. You can't help wanting to have sex with your wife - you're a sexual person, and I'm sure you love her very much. However, speaking from an asexual perspective, I probably understand your wife's situation better than I do yours. I sometimes feel guilty about the fact that my SO and I aren't entirely sexually compatible. I know that he wants to please me and share physical contact with me; that is a core part of a relationship for most people. Whenever we are intimate, I can tell that he wishes he could do more for me, but I'm just not that into sex. And then I feel bad because he feels bad, even though it's neither of our faults. I think that's a key point here - this isn't anyone's fault. You can't help having desires, and she can't help not having them. Both of you are perfectly normal in this. But it is causing friction in your marriage, so it does have to be dealt with. If you've been married long enough that you have more than one child I assume you've probably been through a lot together, and you love each other and want to make each other happy. Start from there. Have a conversation about this with your wife. Remember that no one is the guilty party here, and have a frank discussion about your feelings. Be honest with each other. Once you figure out what each person wants and needs, you can work together to form a strategy to fix the issues you're having. This doesn't have to be a huge issue in your relationship, but it will only get worse if you don't communicate about it.",

    "input_text": "Expectations. I'm a fourteen-year-old girl who just started high school and is pursuing a career in musical theatre. I'm just going to say this right now, I'm not some sort of Rachel Barry (Berry?) wanna-be or some sort of YouTube singer that has no talent or real aspiration, just looking for fame and money, no. I've been aspiring toward the theatres of Broadway since I can remember and I don't want any sort of fame or money. I just want to sing and be heard. And yes, I liked it before it was cool, and I'm fully aware that makes me sound like a hipster. Anyway, like I said, I just started high school, but I have all the expectation piled on me. Honestly and truthfully, I'm good. Some might say great or amazing, but I'm not trying to brag, I'm just letting you know. Because of this, I'm expected to be amazing and inspirational and all that, but I'm not. My mother expects me to get perfect grades, my sister expects me to get the lead in the musical as a freshman, my entire choir expects me to be perfect and on top of my game every day and never make a mistake and they think it's okay to put all the attention on me sometimes when it makes me uncomfortable (because come one, it's a choir), and it goes on and on and on. I can't handle it. I know my limits and my abilities, but noone else does. I'm supposed to be perfect. When I make an achievement, noone cares because it's expected. When I break down, it's just not okay, I'm supposed to handle all of this. When I make a bad grade, my mother tells me that I won't get into college. When I make a good one, it doesn't affect her. I, honest to God, got a 101% in French (granted, it's only the first half of the first quarter), but she was unimpressed because the rest of my grades weren't quite there. They're all B's and A's, and again: I. Just. I'm breaking down. When I was twelve, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. All of my friends had abandoned me for a dumb reason I'm not willing to get into and my parents thought I didn't need help. Every time I reached out to someone for help, they thought I was lying, or be overly-dramatic. I had three failed suicide attempts. ( Note: I AM NOT CURRENTLY SUICIDAL. THIS WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.) Finally, my principal caught wind of my situation somehow and decided to suspend me until I got medical help. ( Just saying, she's a bitch. Never, ever force anyone with a mental problem to get help against their will.) I went to a therapist, I went to the hospital. My parents were in shock. They thought I could handle my own problems. They didn't realize my mom not being there and my dad's abusive, alcoholic, depressive behavior had rubbed off on me. They still don't. They blame everything all on my own inability to take care of myself. I got out three days before my thirteenth birthday. Now here I am, going down a scary path again. The only friends I can get right now and mean to me, selfish, and expect me to be perfect, my parents are ignoring me, and I have all these.... expectations. I'm not okay. I want to self injure again, I'm inclined to take pain killers (I'm not doing these things, nor do I plan to. Just inclined. I have self-control.), I'm lonely, I'm sad...\nI'm not perfect. Well, I guess that's all I really have to say. Thanks for listening to me ramble about myself. I really appreciate it.",

    "input_text": "Losing my mind Ever since my last (and only) serious boyfriend dumped me almost two years ago, I've had a feeling that I was going to die alone. It's not one of those dramatic thoughts like, oh god I was dumped now no one will ever love me, sort of things. Just a quiet realization. I'm going to die alone. My history with romance is pretty shitty. The first guy I ever had a crush on admitted to me that he liked me... He just liked my friend better. The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later. I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get. After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake. After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy. My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? I can't diet because I have no will power. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days. I'm angry all the time, or depressed. No wonder no one likes me. I absolutely loathe my brain. It's trying to kill me, it's trying to destroy me. It wants me to feel this way. I want to know what it's like to be able to function. Not even be happy; just FUNCTION. I can't even do that, though. No wonder I'm going to die alone. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know what I want to hear. I guess I just want to tell someone, and there's no one in my life I could say this stuff to. I feel like a burden, an annoyance, someone who doesn't really matter. I'm scared to sleep because I know if I lay down in bed, I'm just going to think awful thoughts and make myself feel worse than I already do.",

Then I'm leaving. **Dr. Sterling:** Thank you. **Dr. Sterling:** Patient Name - Laura Michaels. Occupation - unemployed. Session Number - twelve of fifteen as mandated by the State Rehabilitation Program. Go ahead, Laura. Tell me about what happened the day at the park. **Laura:** We were sitting on the park bench - the same one we've spent so much time on over the past couple years. The bigger one with no armbars and room for three people. It was 12:30 in the afternoon. **Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure that was the exact time? **Laura:** I don't fucking know! Jesus Christ, you people. Everything's a blur. I'm doing the best that I can. It was lunch time, okay? I know because Mr. Greg Hamilton was out in the park getting his daily hotdog and barbeque chips. Will you let me talk? Bobby and I were meeting at the bench to talk about what to do next. We were enjoying some ice cream cones that he got us because of how stressful everything had been. I was especially out of it that day and he was trying to cheer me up. For as horrible of a life he's put me through that man has a damn good heart. We had to make a decision that day. **Dr. Sterling:** About-\n**Laura:** Yeah. **Dr. Sterling:** We're talking about-\nYes, that decision. I remember telling Bobby that I couldn't stay long...but he showed up with those cones and I couldn't resist his charm. Superman - my favorite. It was hot. I was eating the ice cream pretty fast. It was melting down my hands. It couldn't have been more than five minutes when Bobby broke the silence with his words:\n'You know we have to do it.' Time stopped. My hands squeezed the cone so hard it cracked and fractured. All I could do was sit there licking time by. Everything was so...off, but so right. For a moment, I didn't hate myself anymore. I was okay. Then I started seeing the green dots and everything got so bright that I couldn't see. That's the last thing I remember from the park. **Dr. Sterling:** That's the last memory you can recall? **Laura:** Yes. **Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure? **Laura:** Well, no. It...there wasn't anything else that happened at the park. **Dr. Sterling:** Would you like some tea? **Laura:** Yeah, I'd love some. ---\nThat wasn't all I remembered - it was simply all I was willing to say to Dr. Sterling again. The recording I just transcribed for you was probably the fifth or sixth time I was forced to recount my story. Don't get me wrong, she was an excellent, compassionate woman but even she was skeptical of what happened to me. To the State, I was another junkie who was forced to get clean or go to jail. I believe that impacted her ability to fully trust me. Especially with some of the other heroin addicts I would see in the waiting room. I don't hold any ill will towards her. What happened was so traumatic that I was able to kick heroin with minimal effort - aside from the mandated state program I was forced to go through after my hospital stay. I don't wish it on anyone, but I hope that by sharing my experiences it can create awareness about what the drug can bring you down to. ---\nWhen I was able to see again, I was laying on a cold table staring back at my reflection on a metallic ceiling. I couldn't move at first but I wasn't tied down or anything. It felt like sleep paralysis, if you've ever been through that. No matter how much I struggled to move my body - even wiggle a toe - nothing would happen. I don't remember being scared at all, but when I try hard to remember waking up on that table I run into a mental block. I clearly remember what I saw, and how my body felt. But my emotions and thoughts...I feel like they are being held back. Even to this day. The memory is *right* there but I can't reach it. Almost as if parts of my experience have been censored. Maybe because there were so many bright, blurry lights I wasn't able to focus on my feelings and I just don't have a memory of them. All I can say for certain is that I was on a table because I remember my reflection. I don't have any clue how much time passed. It could have been hours or days. Possibly longer. Possibly shorter. At some point a tall, lanky figure came and injected me in the arm with some sort of serum that burned as it coursed through my veins. I wanted to scream and cry and thrash until I could get off of the table, but my body was motionless. More time passed. My next clear memory is of my legs in stirrups, and the worst pain I've ever felt destroying my abdomen, sucking out my insides. I couldn't see anything except for the lights, but I could feel dozens of thin, warm fingers poking and prodding at every inch of my body. Resonated throughout the area around me. A chant from a murderous cult? Questions from a group of scientists? I don't know. The word haunts my dreams every night. If I even hear the word I break down. The medication can't even protect me from it. I suddenly gained my ability to move as I felt the remaining pieces of my insides being torn away from me. The tall, lanky man stood over me and injected more serum into my neck, causing my world to spin until it went silent and black. I awoke in a hospital bed. So, so many doctors were around me, joined by men and women in suits and two police officers. They had hours of questions for me. The official documentation by the police says that I overdosed on heroin in the park, and Bobby took me to one of those \"back-alley\" doctors to have our baby removed. I don't know if I believe that. They took my baby to the sky for their experiments. They know it. It doesn't matter now. The law is the law. Bobby has been in prison for years. They still haven't found my baby or the alleged doctor. I don't think they ever will. I don't know exactly what happened to me. What I do know is that heroin brought me to that point. It cost me my child. I never got the chance to see his face because a drug was controlling my life and my actions. Stay away from it. Help others get away from it. Don't be me. I would give anything to see my baby. Years might have passed, but I won't forget his name.",

Peer into my eyes and watch as hes devoured. In the late afternoon afternoon, I strolled through our small-town markets and malls, restaurants and theaters, touching all I could. Its amazing how oblivious people can be. Back home, a few hours later, local news reports started coming in. Biological Mystery. Impossible Pregnancies. Each headline fed my reinforcement mechanisms. Elation begat ebullience. Ebullience begat euphoria. I am the Infestor of Wombs. I wandered, undetected, through blockades and cordons and walls. When I chose to be seen, they flocked to me; women walked, girls skipped, infants crawled. Old Me peeked out from behind my eyes, only to retreat, sobbing. Gravid bellies seethed from the impatience of the lives-to-be and threatened to tear their mothers in half. I walked from home to home, invisible again, stroking the hair and skin of my surrogates, watching them smile contentedly during this brief respite from pain. Soon after, they all gave birth. Scores Dead. Devastating Deliveries. Stillbirth Epidemic. My Little Girl crawled to my home as I slept and was waiting on my doorstep the next morning. I bathed Her tiny body and removed the remainder of Her umbilical cord. She stared at me with Her radiant eyes as I poured warm water over Her skin. Extinguish the stars, She whispered, smiling. I kissed the top of her head. I am the Father of Joy. Joy grew as I fed Her throughout the day. Old Me was nearly gone; his presence only manifested as prickles down my spine as Joy raced through Her childhood and adolescence and peaked as a young woman over a period of hours. Joy told me She was ready and I followed Her into the basement. She stood in the center of the dirt floor, beaming at me with adoration. I am the Gaze of Beasts, She breathed. I heard a ripping sound as the corners of Her mouth tore to Her ears. Her teeth cracked and splintered and fell to the floor. Fingernails peeled off and fluttered to the ground like dead moths. Old Me shuddered and exhaled his dying breath. Joy was still for a moment, but then She began to change. I watched in awe as Her flesh sagged and split and the pores of Her skin gave birth to the eyes of Black God.",

I'm *tired* and I know if I go back in the Ink, I'm gonna die.\" The brigadier general nodded, his gaze scanning the tired faces around him. \" You all feel this way?\" Nods followed. He stepped back, and his already deep voice lowered an octave with grim anger. \" If we don't deal with this situation, we are all going to die. That means that you will probably die whether you go back into the Ink or not.\" Unhappy murmurs circled the crowd. As he walked away, his order cut right into our hopes. \" Have them build hotboxes, and put them all through in a rotation until they comply. Two hours each.\" A great unhappy noise swelled among us, but we were soldiers, and we weren't going back into the Ink for the moment so we followed the officers' orders, and began building our own torture devices under the hot Sun. I was already sweaty and tired when they threw me in the one I'd built. It was simple, really - six metal plates bolted together. It hadn't even taken very long to make. But my two hours would feel like forever. I sat in there, sweating, frying, melting for an eternity. All I wanted was to go home. This was a nightmare in every sense. Down one path, there was darkness and hellish threats that continually tore at us, at our sanity down the other, slowly dying in a hotbox. The Sword wasn't going to let us leave. It occurred to me, in a flash of feverish inspiration, that nobody had taken brain scans of the brigadier general himself. How did we know *he* wasn't under some evil influence? What if a neural mosquito had gotten to *him*, and this was its way of slowly killing all of us? I cried, but no tears came out. I was too dehydrated. I remember being very certain that I was going to die in that box before I ever got a chance to grab for that one slim hope\nBut the top did eventually open, and they pulled me out and dumped the next guy in. I stumbled to the nearest water and guzzled it down alongside a long line of other red-skinned soldiers doing the same. As soon as I could, I slipped away, and found Thompson. She was in the techie tent, drawing plans to kill the Preacher. Her face was absolutely filled with hate for that thing and I couldn't blame her but she quickly threw on a neutral expression when she saw me. It was all I could do just to talk through my heat exhaustion. \" I have a theory that the brigadier general's been compromised.\" She regarded me with a skeptical but open look. \" I nodded, and tried to breathe normally. \" This is crazy it's unlike any campaign I've ever been on. That man is driving us forward with torture, and he doesn't care if we die. Do you have any recent brain scans of him? Like you took on us?\" Her gaze went distant for a moment. \" No I don't, actually.\" \"Will you get one?\" I asked, desperate. She nodded. \" You're thinking neural mosquito?\" \"I'll manage it,\" she promised quietly. \" Now get out of here before someone sees you. Nobody can know about this conversation.\" I made it to my bunk and fell before my body completely gave out and they came for me a few minutes later, dragging me back to the hotbox for my next turn. There were a great many people in those boxes, in the sand, in the heat crying. We couldn't last. It simply wasn't possible. Groans and shouts gave way, and we were all spared the hotboxes for agreeing to go back into the Ink the next day. I lay in my empty tent, awake the entire night, hoping against hope that your ex-wife would come through before we had to go back into that dark and silent Hell. She snuck in some time just before dawn, a brain scan document in hand. \"What'd you get?\" I asked, exuberant, even trying to sit up. She shook her head and showed me. \" He's clean.\" \"*What?*\" \"Nothing wrong with his brain. No mosquitoes. Whatever's out in the Ink, it really must be worth all this suffering.\" I remember sobbing uncontrollably. \" \"I'm sorry,\" she said, pouring some water across my reddened forehead. \" But we're all here for a reason. Everything he's done is technically legal.\" She paused. \" But if he gets worse, come to me. I'll make some calls.\" I could only screw up my face and nod. And, then, a few hours later, it was time to gear up and go back out. There was no chatter, no murmurs no talk of any kind. Silent, broken, despairing, we went through the motions of setting up lights and guarding ourselves against unknown threats, but I was sure each of us simply expected to die in some new and horrible way. It was on that day that we finally reached our objective. I think we were six miles deep into the Ink at that point, and four miles straight down thanks to the impossible slope. I envisioned it as an immense unseen crater that existed only inside that valley of darkness\nAnd it was just sitting there at the center of the enormous crater, the slope stretching up and away on all sides. \"Any contact with the Preacher yet?\" the brigadier general asked over the static-filled radio relays. Nobody responded in the affirmative. They wouldn't, because I knew where the Preacher had gone. It had continually retreated whenever we'd tried to attack it and it had vacuumed up more than one of our dead colleagues to add to its bulk. Standing with five other men and staring at the source of the Ink, I knew where it had gone each night. The ten-foot-high sphere sat casually in the sand, like it had simply chosen to fall and rest there. Each edge held an asymptotic darkness, but, within, we saw another place. As we watched, it shifted. Another place and another seconds later, another\nThis was some sort of hellish egg, or black hole, or shadow portal, or *something* and it went to places beyond any of our worst fears. We reported our discovery, and the next order did not surprise us at all. \"All units, gather at the Sphere. We'll deploy each time the blood-lakes and corpse-mountains world appears.\" This time, I knew who spoke. I picked up my radio, and signed what felt like my own death warrant: \"No, sir.\" Another man raised his radio, his gaze aghast as he witnessed what looked like, in all actuality, Hell itself. His words were as tear-filled as his eyes. \" We refuse.\" \"*The Preacher must die!*\" the Sword roared over the radio, his high shout causing a burst of static. Forty men and women now stood outside the Sphere, lit by a weird shadow-light that ignored the ten foot limit, and we looked at each other in confusion. The Preacher? Was that the true objective of our operations? Judging from the anger and hate in that shout, was this some sort of revenge mission? Or had he simply lost it completely? \"Set your charges,\" I remember breathing, and, somehow, everyone heard me. I wasn't in charge, but they listened. We piled up all the C4 and other explosives we had. We took all our mortar shells and rigged them up. We surrounded that fucking thing with enough firepower to blow a hole in reality itself. Fitting, judging by what I guessed that it was. We trekked back through the Ink, unafraid now. Everything that had been in here had been coldly and carefully murdered by thousands of armed men and women, and there was nothing left but us. We'd never figured out who had been leaving our friends' limbs for us to find, but we guessed that, since they hadn't attacked us yet, they never would. Long lines of soldiers trekked out of the Ink together, and we headed back to camp, soul-weary. The Sword was standing there, waiting for us, all of the officers lined up to his left and right. His monolithic stance and grim expression indicated immediately that we were in trouble. Somebody explained what we'd done, and that we'd set a timer on the explosives. He took a breath, and somehow grew even taller. \" Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives.\" \"There's hardly time,\" someone said. \"Reed,\" the Sword ordered, not so much as moving his head. \" Shoot that man in the leg.\" ---\n(continued in one more comment)",

    "input_text": "Unexplained Incident in New Haven Greetings everyone. My name is Dwayne. I'm a state trooper out of New Haven Connecticut. I've been on the force for almost 20 years and a few months back something strange happened that I've not been able to shake. I've always been a bit of a drinker but ever since that night things have been bad. I've been irritable, out of sorts and frankly drinking through each day. I'm hoping that maybe sharing this with someone will help. I can only imagine what my ex would say, so I'm turning towards the anonymous internet instead. It was a fair day and I was cruising down 95 heading back to the station when I got the call. \"Young woman causing a scene crossing interstate 95.\" This was the entirety of the report. I called in to get the mile marker and found that I was relatively close. I had been in a hurry to get off of work that day to see my daughter, but frankly the idea of seeing her mother was enough to encourage my to respond. I called in that I was on my way and headed toward the reported scene. This internet age is crazy. Before I even reached the location I was watching a Youtube video of a young girl running and spinning in circles in the middle of the highway. Sammy at dispatch had texted the link partially so I would know what was happening, but mostly because Sammy was a bored busy-body who loved gossip and glamorization. Regardless, by the time I reached the scene I immediately recognized her. She was hard to miss. She was half naked, with the rags of a white camisole as her only protection against the elements. She was crouched with her shoulder pressed alongside the concrete barrier and frantically peeking over, and then ducking back down. I positioned my car to protect her from the flow of traffic and called in my position. I carefully got out of the car, and approached her a gently as I could. I had spent years dealing with domestic disputes, which more often than not, included some paranoid, drug addled husband. The state of this woman looked very familiar, and I knew not to provoke someone as high as she must have been. She saw me coming from long off and locked eyes with mine as I, step by step, got closer. I held my hands low, palms down, showing that I was not a threat. I was good at this and it worked. She let me get within speaking distance without becoming startled, though her eyes were wild and full of trepidation. \"Sweetheart, I'm here to help you.\" She ignore me, instead popping her head up and looking over the barrier to the opposite side of the highway. I looked and saw nothing. \"You're in danger, young lady\"\nShe spun her head to eyeball me intensely. she whispered forcefully. Let me help you. Get into the car and we'll leave.\" I walked towards the car, looking over my shoulder to see her positioning and preparing to follow me like a cat. The moment my door was open she darted from her position and was in the back seat of my cruiser faster than I would have imagined possible. I pulled away and headed back to the station, all the while looking at her in my rear view. She was cut, bruised, scraped and clearly not well. She kept darting from one window to another looking for something. \"You're going to be ok now. Can you tell me what happened?\" \"They're coming.\" She was distracted, still on the lookout. \"Did someone hurt you? Are they here?\" I slowed the car a bit in case the perp was in the local vicinity. She did not answer, yet her answer was clear. She was obviously worried about being found by the people who hurt her. I called into dispatch telling them that I had secured the girl, and that I was on my way back now. She completely flipped out. She started kicking the seat behind me, spinning her body and screaming. They'll hear! They'll find us!\" tears were streaming down her cheeks. You're safe with me. They won't be able to hurt you. Do they have a police scanner? Is that what you mean?\" I was now starting to realize that this girl might not be crazy or drugged. Her eyes were clear, and although highly disturbed, she did not seem to have the classic signs of a tweaker. \"They will hear.\" She lowered her voice, looking into my eyes in the mirror. No more radio. We'll get you back to the station.\" She calmed a bit and fumbled with her hands between her knees. We only had a few minutes left until we reached the station and the detectives would take over. My curiosity got the better of me and I continued to ask questions. I knew that this was perhaps my only chance to actually figure out what was happening, and frankly the idea of tracking down the scum that hurt this young girl was exciting. \"Who did this. Do you know where they are?\" \"Elsewhere. They took me. They took me long ago and.... it's different. That place. They found me, and they're looking again.... to take me back, to take me.\" She was slow and despondent now. \"What does it look like, the place? \"It's... It's bad, and purple. It comes in waves but they hurt. They pull at you, tearing. And the flashes, they... they pull too... but... your brain, your eyes.\" This was getting nowhere fast. I decided that I was not likely to get any legitimate information at this point and stopped. My silence was interrupted by her fresh screams. She held her temples with the palms of her hands, fingers extended, shouting \"They're here now, they found me!\" Over her deranged shouting I heard the break of my radio, and answered it. \"Car 19, this is dispatch, what's you're location?\" This was so routine as to be automatic for me. I looked out the drivers side window to check and replied instantly. \"Mile marker 36.\" Then something stuck me. \" \"Sammy, that you?\". I got nothing in return. \" And then it was too silent. I looked in my rear view to nothing but an empty seat. I jammed my breaks and pulled to the breakdown lane, and ran out of the car. I checked the back thoroughly to find nothing. She was just.... gone. There was no sign she'd ever even been there. I came back to the station empty handed. I was questioned about what was going on. I told them the truth. I told them every single part of what I'm telling you. What I got in return was a 3 week leave, and to never be looked at without concern since. I still have my career, but no one on the force treats me the same. I don't treat myself the same. I learned on that day that there was something enormous and unexplained among us. I was no threat to it, probably not even a consideration compared to that. But \"that\" exists. My reality is theirs. They are here, and there is nothing I can do about it. I just pray that they never want me.",

    "input_text": "Babysitting for the Fitzwillys (Part 2) **Part 1**: <URL>\n*\"Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop*\n*When the wind blows, the cradle will rock*\n*When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall*\n*And down will come baby, cradle and all . . .\"* I must have sung that one a thousand times, Margery joining in with no small amount of gusto. That was my first task. Put precious Jaime to bed. And Jaime loves nursery rhymes, so I was forced to sing to him as I rocked him in my arms and Margery danced to the tune, eyes closed, arms whirling. Lionel and Bosworth were nowhere to be found. Dylan took it all without so much as a minuscule shift in his expression. I studied his face as I held him, trying to gage his thoughts, trying to peer into his state of mind and wordlessly ask him about the horrors he had endured in the last decade. There was nothing. I had prayed to see anger in those brown depths, hatred toward his captors maybe, embers of resolve but it was as if all the fight had gone out of him. He seemed . . . My heart clenched. Eventually, Dylans eyes began to droop and he nestled into my chest as though he were a real baby. For the briefest of moments I thought I could feel him squeeze my arms quickly a sign of recognition or a plea for help. But my fleeting hope disappeared once I realized he had actually fallen asleep. Hed been a chubby kid, but there was so little of him now that I knew I wouldnt need help lifting him. He was so malnourished that I barely struggled to carry him to his crib. It was marginally bigger than a regular one and my heart broke at the thought of him lying here for years, the implications for not only his physical health but his psyche as well. This was humiliating. What were they playing at? Forcing a grown man to pretend to be a baby? After I put him down, I felt Margerys claw-like hand clasp my shoulder. He is so precious, my little boy. I can see that youve grown attached to him already. There is a bond. Her overly-animated voice chirped in my ear, her mouth so close to my face I could smell something rancid on her breath. She giggled in that creepy way of hers, a sound that bore no trace of happiness or joy, but rather seemed to slowly scrape away at my sanity. Like nails on a chalkboard. You have been the only nanny so far who has been so helpful. She placed her chin on my neck, its boniness digging into my skin. Revulsion washed over me in waves and I had to force myself not to shake off her grip. You are the only one that seems to connect with our little Jaime. The others were all so . . . Here she sighed dramatically, her impossibly wide grin tilting downwards. She giggled again, squeezing my shoulder. But youre a good little girlie, arent you? Youre not going to disappoint us like they did. You are going to stay with us, become part of our family. Were so excited to have you here. I could hear the blood pound in my ears. What . . . what happened to the other nannies? I asked quietly. Margerys smile grew even wider, more malicious. Oh, we had to let them go. But theyre safe, theyre sorry, theyre so, so beautiful now. She pinched my cheek. Lovely rose of a young woman, you are. Then she practically leaped away from me and began chanting Ring-Around-The-Rosie, winking at me before skipping out of the nursery. Only once she left did I release the breath Id been holding. I had to stay sane, strong. I couldnt fall apart. I couldnt cry. I couldnt freak out. I needed to keep my head if I was going to get us both out of here. I was offered a guest bedroom but told them Id rather sleep in the babys room, in case he woke in the middle of the night or something. Margery assured me that Jaime never did that, he was not one of those naughty toddlers. I spent the entire day scoping out the room, looking for hidden cameras as subtly as I could. I found two, one hidden between the knickknacks of a shelf and the other in the button of a teddy bear. I pretended to check on him as he slept, but I was actually poking at Dylan, trying to wake him. I wasnt sure how I was going to get rid of the cameras without them noticing, but I couldnt wait until Id come up with a good enough idea to talk to him. He was practically comatose. He didnt budge, not an inch, not even when I pinched him so hard his skin bruised. It was almost as if theyd drugged him. I was invited to have supper with them a few hours later. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to endure, sitting opposite them, watching them eat and carry on as though they had not destroyed the life of my best friend. I thought of his parents, how heartbroken they were when their sons case was closed. A lump formed in my throat. I couldnt be sentimental. I couldnt be weak, not if I wanted to survive. If I wanted to get out of this, I had to be calm and I had to be clever. I dragged my fork through the mashed potato on my plate, not intending to eat anything these monsters were serving me. I didnt drink anything, either. I went to the bathroom or kitchen and drank water from the tap if I got thirsty. I cleared my throat politely. Margery stopped her singing and looked at me expectantly, food crested around her mouth which still hung open mid-song. That damn woman could never stop singing. Um, I had a thought. She smiled encouragingly at me. I continued. If I am going to take on this job, you expect me to be here full-time, right? She nodded slowly, her head lolling to the side. Lionel remained quiet, polishing off the steak on his plate. Bosworth, whod been lurking in the corner of the room, looked as nervous as ever. I took a deep breath. Well, thats not going to work. I mean, you took my phone, right? If I just stay here and skip all of my classes and not let anyone know that Im ok, then theyre going to worry and call the police. Theyll look for me, thinking Im unsafe or being hurt and if they find me here, which they will, then they\nMargery suddenly let out a loud, inhuman-sounding screech, covering both of her ears as she shook her head violently. The sudden display chased my planned speech right back down my throat and I nearly pissed my pants right then and there. Then suddenly, she stopped. Just like that, as though she could turn off her craziness with a switch. She smiled at me, spittle glistening on the sides of her mouth, dripping down her chin. She cocked her head to the side again. Youre not planning on disappointing us, are you? Her voice had returned to its normal, chirpy cadence as she singsong-ed the words, but there was a very evident threat beneath the sugar. I shook my head no. No, no, of course not. I want to be here. I want to be part of this family. That seemed to steady her mood. She straightened her head. I was learning the outlines of their insanity, learning where to tread and where to sidestep. All I was trying to say was that I should let at least one person know that Im safe. If I could call someone, they would make sure that no one informs the police or gets the wrong idea. For what must have been a full minute she said nothing, just stared at me, smiling. I never thought a smile could make me feel as sickened as I did then. But there was something worse than Margery Fitzwillys smile. Finally, finally, she answered. I suppose that makes sense, dear. Though, you must understand, weve had so many girls and boys who said they wanted to be a part of our family too. They disappointed us. They tried to get away from us, tried to get us in trouble. I like you, girl. I really, really do. I would hate for you to be just another disappointment. She flattened her veined, weathered hands on the table. But I do see your point. We shall need to trust you first. Trust must be earned. Then she stood, as did Lionel. They both left without another word to me. Bosworth escorted me to the nursery. Dylan was still asleep. I tried talking to Bosworth but he simply shut me in the nursery and bolted the door from the outside. I sank into the rocking chair beside the crib and just sat there for what felt like hours, stewing over what I could possibly do to earn their trust. Only once the idea began to form in my mind, did I allow myself the luxury of falling asleep. The next morning brought a fresh sense of determination. When I woke up, Dylan was on his knees and leaning against the bars of his crib, looking at me. I couldnt say anything to him just yet. I knew we were being watched and listened to. So I got him out and dressed him in day clothes. I could hear his hollow stomach rumbling, so I carried him downstairs. The door had been unlocked in the early hours. I had to put him in a giant high-chair and then feed him a bottle of formula. Something made me feel vaguely uneasy about the white liquid, but he drank it greedily, and I made a mental note to try and replace it with something else. Margery made me play with him, flying toys through the air and making all the sound effects as well. I tried moving through the house under the guise of our little games, trying to spot my phone, but of course it was never in plain sight. Dylan remained as quiet as death, but still tried to grab the toys I teased him with, acting out the role so faithfully I wondered if he had started to lose his real identity through the years. Nothing overtly strange happened until about mid-afternoon. I had taken a bathroom break and when I came back, Margery was waiting for me outside. She tilted her head to the side in her regular, creepy fashion, and pointed to where Dylan lay sniffling. The baby needs changing. My stomach dropped. No, they werent going to make me do this. Yes, they were. I was forced to change Dylans diaper. Hed shit himself quit badly, and there was something different about his demeanour, a fracture in his previous monotony. I was more concerned about the humiliation this guy must have felt than having to clean up his shit. This was the regular pattern of events for about a week. I fed him, burped him, changed him, played with him, sang to him, put him to sleep. The initial bubble of hysterical laughter that had accompanied nearly every routine had long since vanished by the third day of this. I was getting angrier, wearier, more pissed off. I had to try and gain their trust by making them think I was being compliant but I didnt know how much more of this I could take. I still couldnt communicate with Dylan safely, for someone was always watching us. I eventually memorised the layout of the bottom floor as I was never allowed up the stairs. But I knew the living areas and kitchen and library and nursery quite well, even discovered a crawlspace hidden in the back of the nursery, though it lay in one of the cameras line of vision. The day eventually came when Margery allowed me my phone call, after I managed to convince her that people would definitely be starting to worry now. I had put Dylan down for his nap. It was late afternoon, early evening. I was called into the kitchen and handed my phone, the Fitzwillys and Bosworth facing me, waiting to listen to make sure I didnt say anything I shouldnt. Lionel leaned over my shoulder, watching me select the number. I couldnt call the police. The only person who was in my city right now, who Id known for a long time and who might believe the insanity of my situation was Zander. So I clicked on his contact. Lionel nodded. Zander, to my eternal shock and everlasting gratitude, actually picked up on the forth ring. his voice was distorted and there was a ton of noise in the background. He was obviously busy, at some event or other. Yeah, um, hi. My voice was surprisingly even. I shifted my gaze to take in all of the three people around me. Lionel still waited behind me, Margery stood to my left and Bosworth to my right. The counter stood in front of me. From the sound of his voice, I was probably the last person on this planet Zander would ever imagine calling him. I could practically hear him raising his eyebrows. Uh, how have you been? Im good, Ive been good, thanks. Look, Teresa, not that Im being an asshole or anything, but why are you calling me? I cant say hi to an old friend? I laughed the fakest laugh I had ever emitted in my life. Youre hilarious. Okay, Im gonna need you to listen to me very carefully, okay? Teresa, whats going\nI shoved Lionel as hard as I could, careful to not end the call. I dove over the counter and felt Margery grab onto my foot. I lifted my other leg and kicked her hard in the face. She fell back with a scream and I ran like hell to the nursery. I grabbed the key from the outside lock, shut the doors and bolted it. Dylan was still asleep, still put out by whatever shit they put in his formula before every nap and sleep session. I put the phone to my ear, heart beating out of control. Zander was still in mid-sentence. iously, what the fuck is going on over there? The background noise had faded to a murmur. He must have gone somewhere quieter. His voice was angry but there was concern as well. I could already hear Margerys banshee-like screams, I could hear the thundering of footsteps down the hall. Listen, please! Im with Dylan right now and were in a trouble. You need to get the cops to come over here and now! The people were with might kill us! Bosworths heavy blows began shaking the door. I moved to take Dylan out of the crib and hide him, just in case theyd try to hurt him. Zander, please, youre the only one who can help us. What, did you just say 'Dylan'? I dont\nI SWEAR TO GOD THIS ISN'T A JOKE! PLEASE JUST GET HELP! I screamed out the address at him several times before my phone died. I rushed around the room looking for the cameras, then covered them. I turned off the light and began dragging Dylan to the crawlspace Id mapped out in my head. We had just reached it when the door came flying off its hinges. I quickly laid Dylan inside as comfortably as I could in my haste and left the door semi-open, moving a chair in front of it. The light came on and then Bosworth was picking me up by the arms. I kicked out, as hard as I could, catching him once in the groin and he barely flinched. That was . . . not normal. He threw me to the floor and when I looked up, I looked up into the most horrific sight I had ever seen in my life. I thought Margery Fitzwillys smiles were unsettling. But they was nothing compared to the long, long frown she wore that dipped past her sagging jowls. Her face was bloody from the kick my boot had delivered, thick blood pouring out of her nose. Her eyes had gone dark, something vicious and evil barely restrained behind them. Lionel wasnt there. Just Margery, in her terrifying glory. She leaned down until her bleeding nose nearly touched mine. Naughty, naughty girl. Why did you do that? She tilted her head to the side, several degrees further than what looked comfortable or natural. I felt a dread unlike any other I had ever experienced before begin to seep into my very soul. Take her. She straightened herself and Bosworth picked me up again, dragging me by the arms out of the nursery. She sang as I was carried screaming across the floors of the house and down a flight of stairs, her voice the same eerie chirrup that only fed my terror and panic. *Ring-a-round the rosie,*\n*A pocket full of posies,*\n*Ashes! *We all fall down . . . * **Final**: <URL>",

I am going to find another doctor a state over where I will be for a while so I will offer to take drug tests. I did learn that if I bring my mom with me to the doctor they will take me seriously and trust me with narcotics. ( My mom took me to an urgent care because she couldn't deal with me being in so much pain constantly and they gave me tramadol). Hopefully when I establish a new doctor and bring my mom with it will work out. I also have an appointment with my pain specialist on Monday as well as a psychiatrist with the pain clinic. I'm worried they will still think I shouldn't be on the stuff that works and allows me to function at least a little. At this point I don't expect to be able to go back to work but I at least expect to be treated well enough as a patient that I can get decent enough management that I can go to the store and take a shower in the same day. I really don't get how everyone else is able to get treatment but me. Maybe that's not very accurate but it's how I feel. I am always completely honest with them. I tell them that I want less pain but I also want to be careful with meds because my dad is an alcoholic and my sister is on heroin. While my dad is very functional the last thing I want is to end up like my sister. I am seeking drugs so I can have a life, not ruin it. I get that the regulations on narcotics are pretty serious and I know they don't want to give those meds to someone my age but shit. It sucks being 23 and feeling like my life is over. I am already going to have to go on disability and I already left my job and home where my partner is to come 2000 miles to get better. My pain makes my depression so much worse. And the fucking brain fog. I can't even think straight. I'm so irritable all the time. My jaw hurts so bad sometimes that I end up on a slimfast diet for weeks at a time. Half the time I don't even want to eat because it all puts me in a weird mood. I can't wait to see the psychiatrist. I think they will understand better. And about the modeling thing. Part of me really wants to but I am not nearly as photogenic as I used to be. I am also not as fit and my skin is bad now.

My prison is dark and I cannot see anything. From time to time, I hear sounds from the outside world. They are distorted and muffled, but I can make out my captors voices just enough to notice an eerily gleeful tone. The distant sounds of music also make their way into my ears. My captors play classical music all the time. Classical motherfucking music. I cant stand to hear it. Im trapped here and theyre forcing me to listen to fucking Mozart. I want to go home to my wife and daughter. Will I ever see them again? I smash my arms and legs against the walls of my cell; they are met with a spongy surface coated in nauseatingly squishy mucus. I guess not being able to see has its advantages. Im terrified of knowing what these walls are made of. The last thing I remember before waking up is going to a take-out restaurant to pick up a meal for my family. My wife asked me to have it delivered since it was raining so hard, but I insisted on going. The food is warmer when I go get it myself. Delivery boys always seem to stop by our house at the end of their route, and I didnt feel like having another lukewarm meal. I grabbed my keys and ran out the door, jokingly promising Id be back home in time for supper. After picking up our meal, I headed back towards my house. The rain wasnt letting up at all. My wipers could barely handle the load. I knew Id be home soon so I kept going at the same speed. It was a terrible mistake. I watched as a car on the opposing lane flew through a puddle and rammed me straight off the road. Clutching the steering wheel tightly, I tried to regain control of my vehicle. The image of the tree I hit is still burned into my retinas. I cannot recall anything after that. Ive been in this cell for so long, I barely remember how to talk. Im so lonely. My little Sophia will be turning 7 soon. Orhas she already turned 7? Its hard to tell time anymore. I used to count the days, but after they turned into months, I lost track. I want to go home. I want to hold my wife and kids in my arms and tell them I love them. Im not a perfect man by any means, but what did I ever do to deserve this? What did my FAMILY ever do to deserve this? I want to sit around our old kitchen table, with its crayon stains and chipped corners. As my thoughts continue to drift, I suddenly realize its getting harder to breathe. Theres something around my neck. My emaciated arms reach up to try and pull it off, but I havent the strength to do so. Maybe its better this way. My family must have moved on by now. I welcome the sweet relief of death. With freedom at my fingertips, I feel a large hand reaching for me and pulling me out of my prison. You son of a bitch! I was ready to die, damn it! Its too bright to see anything, so I keep my eyes closed. I can barely breathe. I cant move at all. I feel the hand slapping me firmly on the back, dislodging a chunk of mucus from my throat. I must have swallowed it when he was pulling me out. I cry out for my family. I scream and scream, begging for them to take me home. They dont listen to me. I hear them laughing. The man holding me speaks out: Its a boy! No shit, Sherlock. What the fuck did you expect?! Did you think my genitals would shrivel off while you kept me locked up!? I continue to scream and thrash about in a desperate attempt to free myself. Nothing works. Fucking shit. I must be in hell. ---------\nIve been out of my spongy cell for a few months now. It was hard for my eyes to adjust to the light. I must have been in captivity for longer than I thought. My captors pretend not to understand when I scream at them. The dark cell has been traded in for a more traditional prison made of metal bars. I tried escaping many times, but Ive always been caught. I think my captors are filming me. Those sick sons of bitches. They laugh and taunt me, jiggling my prisons keys just outside my reach. They make fun of my broken body. They take such pleasure in watching me trying to crawl away whenever they take me out of my cell, only to place me back where I started. Their cruelty knows no bounds. They dont even allow me the dignity of using the bathroom on my own. Its just as wellif they treat me like an animal, then I will act like an animal. I find great pleasure in retaliating against them by urinating on them when ever they try to shame me. I feel no shame anymore. I only feel the burning desire for revenge. When they feed me their poisonous food, I toss it back to them and try my hardest to throw up on them. I make a game out of trying to get it into their mouths. I know now that I will never be free, but I sure as fuck wont go down without a fight. I will spend every damn day of this miserable life trying to inflict onto them the same hell theyve inflicted onto me. I wait at night for them to go to bed, and then I scream at the top of my lungs. I enjoy causing them sleep deprivation. Its just a little solace in my otherwise horrid experience. Sophia, my darling daughter. If you can hear meplease know that I love you. Cher, my beautiful wife, Im sorry I didnt take your advice. I should have just had the meal delivered. I hope you know how much I miss and adore you both. Please know that I am here against my will. I would do anything to be in your arms again. I love you.",

    "input_text": "Up late Thought I'd post Im 17 years old going into my senior year in high school. The past years of high school have been rough. Freshman year most of my friends went off to hang out with other cliques and shit and started acting like dicks (HIGHSCHOOL WOW). In the winter of my sophomore year I got diagnosed with fucking type 1 diabetes. I'm to embarrassed to tell anyone I'm diabetic which leads to me not taking insulin for days on end. After I got hit with diabetes about two years ago I really stopped giving a fuck. I started smoking weed and drinking shortly after getting it, my grades went to shit too. As soon as I discovered weed I knew I was gonna be hooked. It was the easiest way to get rid of all of my problems temporarily and I loved it, I was smoking 4 times a day by that summer. In my head I knew getting diabetes triggered all this drug use and shit but I really didn't care, I never really valued myself before I got diagnosed but the way I saw it getting diabetes was my excuse to get away with a ton of shit. My parents first caught me with weed a week after I smoked for the first time. They drug tested me and then took my shit, my Dad whooped my ass and then screamed at me to never do it again. I promised him I wouldn't but I was fucking lying right through my teeth. I was so fucking mad the first time I got caught, I felt like I never got my turn to actually experiment with weed before I got caught. Getting caught by my parents triggered a whole downward cycle. They would catch me like once every two weeks after that and I was grounded 24/7. Obviously I wasn't going to stop smoking weed so I could be ungrounded so, I constantly snuck out and ran away to go get drunk or high with my friends. This went on for about 6 months and as time went on my relationship with my parents got worse. To the point where my mom refused to speak to me for a week after I didn't confess to stealing $500 from her wallet (money that was supposed to be spent on my Dad for his birthday. I'm such a piece of shit I know). Last January I ran away one evening and took 25i NBOME (pretty much fake lsd- I thought It was real at the time) and had a horrible trip. During the trip I felt like my life was stuck in the same 1 hour loop for eternity along with some other scary shit. Afterwards though I was fucking losing my mind. My ego was completely shattered and all I wanted to do when I got home was apologies to my parents and cry with my Mom. I though I had given myself brain damage so after coming clean to my parents I vowed to stay sober and rebuild my relationship with my parents (no brain damage though). My Mom put me in therapy that February and I started taking anti anxiety meds soon after. I thought that if I cleaned up my act it would help me understand more about who I am but that didn't work at all and after suffering for two months sober I started doing drugs again last April. It's July now. Im still stealing from my parents to buy weed. I hate myself completely but I don't care about myself enough to fix anything. My parents are really pushing my to go to collage but I'm really not interested at all. I feel as if this is all being forced upon me and I don't get a say. All my parents seem to care about is getting me into a collage so they can go brag to their fucking friends about me. They make me so fucking mad. I'm still in therapy but it really isn't helping. My parents caught me again and I got into a huge fight with my Dad where I ended up running away, stealing a 40 oz from 711 and sleeping on a park bench. My parents I just don't care about anything in anymore. My life is meaningless, all life is in general. It's impossible for anyone to be content ever. I feel that because I'm aware of the sad reality of this world i'll never be able to be happy. I don't want to pick a career, I don't want to go to collage and I really don't want to live anymore. The only thing stopping me from jumping off a bridge one night is my irrational fear that when we die we stay in our bodies unable to move or communicate. Thus leaving me stuck inside a box for all of eternity. That wouldn't explain what would happen to people who are cremated though. I digress\nThis may sorta come out funny cuz I just wrote this while alone and drunk in my basement. I am a complete nobody with no interests no skills and no motivation to do anything about it. normally reread my reddit posts but im too drunk for that shit sorry for spelling\nTL;DR: I'm a self destructive idiot who feels sorry for himself.",

To be happy and the person people wanted me to be. People think that a kid with a disability just is overnight accepted. There's a large amount of me that hates everyone and everything because *MY Son* has autism. I did everything right. I ate all the proper foods, avoided everything I was supposed to, did everything right. But alas I have a kid with autism and my ex friend who drank and did drugs while pregnant with both her children has normal kids. Sometimes I hate God. Sometimes I fear I hate my son. Sometimes I hate my husband. And sometimes, I probably actually hate my son. A lot of the time I hate myself. From 2012 to 2014 I drank while my son was at school and after he'd gone to bed. All the while wishing I could just leave and live in a trailer on a reservation drinking myself to death like I'd been told my father had done. Even now, I constantly think about suicide. Every day, no matter how great or bad the day is. It often seems like the only way out of Autism. But then I remember that he needs me and I don't. To get to the point where I wasn't just faking happiness and functionality, it took a lot of therapy. It's going to be a while. He may need to talk to someone. He might never be able to deal. Some people take it harder. Typically men. Like they fucked up somehow. That's how I feel. Like I did something wrong and this is my fault. I logically know it isn't. I logically know that things don't work like that. But the brain is tricky. It allows you to know a logical thing but also know an illogical thing and still despite your brain yelling that it's not logical to think that you created this situation, to follow that illogical thought to the point of destroying yourself, knowing also that destroying yourself won't logically fix it and still working towards the idea that it will. Give him time. I seemed fine at first. I was the perfect autism mom for the first year or so. But eventually all that faking took a toll. If he's not taking it well at the start let him.

Who was going to become now? Was I going to become someone evil? The feeling of depression made me think my soul was gone rotten. I started reading the bible to learn how to live properly, but all I could see was condemnation and I became convinced I was going to hell. A particular line where Jesus says something like 'you shouldn't even imagine being with your neighbour's wife because it's the same as doing it' (I'm paraphrasing) convinced me to think a sinful thought was the same as committing that sin. I thought, ok, I must not think any sinful thoughts. Which of course, sparked them off. Everytime I had a violent thought I freaked out and tried to suppress it or pulverise that part of my mind. All this just made the thoughts stronger and more persistent. I wonder if I done things differently, if I hadn't gotten so out of control, if I had got better help, if I hadn't read bible, would I have been ok? I'm nearly forty now, it's been a very difficult 16 years, although I have gotten a lot better.

Its not something you can do more than once or twice at a movie without draining the cup and risking a bathroom break during something important, but Im in the mood to to sink with a smile into sense-filling sweetness. As the rolling flavor fades from my senses, I sigh with contentment. The older man to my right looks on with slightly wide eyes. I really thought that trailer had spoiled the end of the movie. Touching my cheek, I trace an old scar that I always liked to think healed in the shape of a black holes halo. It hadnt been there a moment ago, but the round bullet hole and two pointed corners where it had been stitched shut had collectively graced my left cheek for years; Id only just noticed and remembered. What, that girl shooting up through her own face to escape? Nah, they wouldnt end a movie like that. Not flashy enough. He nods with understanding, if not agreement. Glancing left, I notice one of my friends to the left of Tacitus. His hair is blood red and his skin is pale under the shifting light of the screen. I ask with excitement. When did you get here? He must not hear me over the noise and thunder of the previews; like Tacitus, he gazes unmoving at the picture. This must be a very safe place to you, the man says. Still smiling, I turn back to address him. Special, absolutely. I laugh with nostalgia. The bi-lustrum had just come, and among the movies they blasted to us was a little film that had missed the last one by barely a week. Can you believe that? It was released in the Empire four days after, which meant we didnt get to see it until *ten years* later. Oh, it would have changed everything about our own cinema. He matches my smile with a kind one of his own. It was that good? More than you know. I think back. It took the military caste by storm. My grandfather let me go see it on a school trip; some sort of special field trip just for the military kids. I focus on the screen as images of Imperial Legate Blue appear just as I remember. Countless rows of smartly-dressed children salute him on his high tapestried station as he salutes back, jokes with Imperial Legate Red whose face is on a nearby screen, and then introduces the movie. I grin wickedly. Nineteen-eighty-six. Already ten years old by the time we saw it, but it was absolutely timeless. Ah, yes... an instant classic. I ask, Youve seen it? For some reason, I had vaguely expected that he had not. Something about his manner hints that he is a foreigner; perhaps he is from another continent. He does not answer. His slightly crooked nose throws random shadows across his face as he turns his gaze around the theater. So this place is special to you, but not safe? Shaking my head, I look up into the vast dark void above. The ceiling is black, but visible; definitely present, but still high and distant. When the movie actually starts, Im thankful, for it absorbs my full attention and pulls me somewhere else. Here in the dark, in the long minutes before it begins, I feel reversed. I am as a spider clinging to the ceiling above an infinite and unknowable depth full of icy chills, absolute silence, and utter loneliness. He follows my gaze upward and replies solemnly, I see. In the current preview being shown, a lost little girl reaches for her mothers hand in the forested night, but her mother has vanished, and she is alone. I look away from both the darkness above and the moving light ahead. After an uncomfortable moment resisting some unknown chill, I continue. Anyway, it was a double feature. Predator and Die Hard, back to back, and no school at all. That was the best day *ever.* That sounds wonderful. It must have deeply affected you, being surrounded by children your age all boisterous and full of camaraderie after a day of pure on-screen bravado. Laughing, I said, More than you know. I really needed that feeling. Genuinely compassionate, he asks, How many weeks before had your parents been exiled? A rising choir of screams emanates from the trailer that has now been placed upon our screen. That same actress from the first trailer with the distinctive wound in her left cheek is now in another upcoming movie; here she clings to the inner top of a well while her world begins undergoing a Dimensional Rotation. I laugh heartily. Oh man, not this cliche again. This is like the tenth movie to use that plot device. Dont they know the Legates would *never* do something so absurdly drastic? Its just not believable! And does this movie even have a makeup department? It looks like shes still exhausted from that other movie! Passed out, in fact... I trail off as I began to feel strangely uncomfortable. He gives a kindly worried grimace. She really does need to wake up. Her friends cant hold her ankles much longer. Someone opens a door behind us in the theater. Light streams in, blinding me. Someone else opens an emergency exit door. Wind from outside roars in, throwing my hair about wildly as my face hits the back of the seat in front of me. Combat skills and determination won't be enough to survive this! he shouts in my ear. Think it through! What does a Dimensional Rotation do? Breathing becomes incredibly hard, and I gasp; indeed, it was the outward rush of air and drop in pressure that had momentarily knocked the girl in the preview unconscious in the first place. Theyre literally *turning the planet,* I tell him, gripping the seats in an effort not to be torn up and away into the black. Rotating... local spacetime. It wont make the holes go away... but it will change where they go...\nThereby cutting off your enemy, he yells. Smart tactic! \"Smart...\" I can only barely manage a whisper as the battering gale tears all presence from my lungs. Except for this part...\nConsciousness returned in a disorienting instant. Grabbing jutting stones instinctively as I upended, I stared up into a long circular darkness where dozens of terrified people hung like so many wide-eyed spiders staring down at me. The closest was a dirt-covered and gritted face at the shoulder end of a straining arm. How was Flavia above me? If the well was up, then down waswe had just been talking about my greatest fear, a secret born within me from my vulnerable youthful years, and that animal terror reared up just outside my awareness\n*Don't look down!* Flavia shouted something, but I couldn't hear her over the deafening winds holding me aloft. *don't look down*\nThe turbulent gale was so powerful that the mud had been stripped from her hair. *don't look down don't look down don't look down don't look down don't look down*\nIn a wide arc, the blonde halo danced chaotically around her head like the Medusa of old. *don'tlookdowndon'tlookdowndon'tlookdown*\nIndeed, the full realization of my situation turned me to stone as I saw the reflected tint of the skies augmenting that blue already present in her eyes. There was nothing but open void below waiting to swallow me; light and windy rather than dark and silent, but void nevertheless. The paralysis of that childhood terror took me, and I slipped from her grasp in an eternally long moment of mutual shocked stares and flailing hands. A single sharp violin note in my heart slowed time to infinity, but there was nothing for it. DownI was sinkingdown! no!a millimeter an eon, but it was already too late. As I sank into a deeper current, that long violin note faded in favor of the wind's all-encompassing roar, and the well in the ceiling of the world shrank at a startling pace. As I curved away from it, I saw Flavia leap forth; where she had once considered giving up by falling in, she was now jumping out of that same well and off of that same ledge with the fire of life. A gripping fist slammed me into earth, and I bounced and flipped over fully once before grabbing at dirt with my fingers. Momentarily flat, I turned my face up against the hot wind and looked a planetary crisis in the eyes. Dirt soared at me like an endless plane of flowing dust; only buildings, trees, and the distant well stood against it. The clouds were unrecognizable speeding tracts of jagged white on tempestuous blue racing by overhead. Indeed, if I understood right, the atmosphere would be the first thing to feel the effects of the Rotationit was the least anchored and the most mobile, and was far heavier by mass than anyone usually gave it credit for. All around the world, the entire atmosphere had begun to move all at once, and that initial maelstrom had torn Rufus away, and then me. From what I'd seen in the movies, there would be a small lull after the chaos ebbed; after the air stopped tripping on itself and began moving smoothly in concert, but before it began picking up real speed. That moment would be my only chance. And I was so tired. My fingers held all of my remaining strength, and employed it fully to dig into grass and loam. The wind grew warmer as the energy being expended found sink in the atmosphere; I gasped against dirt and dust to breathe. My outward sigh of pain coincided with a quieting breeze as the moment approached, and I tried to climb to my kneesbut failed. Firm hands pulled me up by my forearm, and I tried again, this time succeeding. Flavia pushed forward against the wind alongside me, and even spoke words of determination, but I could not hear her over the whisper turning into dragon's breath around us. It was different this time. No longer were there curling currents of chaos curving this way and that through the woods and ways of our world; the gale was now unified, constant, and rising. Often with storms there is an innate apprehension as one awaits the ebb of a particular blast, and keening adrenaline as it rises higher and higher, suggesting the idea that *this one might just keep getting stronger*I felt that adrenaline, for I knew this force would not stop. She and I ran forward together stumbling; walked together; pushed and shouted against a flat palm of brutal force at the last; fell flat and clutched the earth again mere steps from the well as the roar grew beyond deafening, the vibration of the ground shook us to our core, and the sheer force began peeling us away from our handholds. There were only two planes now, both opaque, smooth, and blazing past. One was dull brown and one was bright blue, but they both screamed doom. I kept my head up and my eyes and mouth turned away, but like a powerful ocean current that I had somehow sunk into up to my elbows, the brown pulled past with unstoppable strength. My fingers finally let go. I hear you again, playing that distant violin, for I am about to die. I know this. I do not accept it, but I know it. There can be no surviving this speed, this sheer kinetic energy, and I tumble half in that flat brown plane and half out, breathing in the scant instants I can before hitting the earth again and again. If I could just *see*, I might try to\nThe pain hits beyond belief, but somewhere far away where I can barely feel it. I am back in the movie theater again for a brief lapse; the man with the crooked nose stands over me in concern as I lay crumpled between the seats. I'm not sure why, but I need to know. I ask desperately, \"Is Flavia here?\" He looks left for a moment, and then smiles and shakes his head. \" Heaving awake, I pushed at the encompassing pressure crushing every limb. Metal rods and massive broken foundations jutted around me, but something marginally softer had prevented my impalement. Turning my head, I saw who I had landed against. The rods had stabbed into he who had traveled upon this path first, and thus his last act had been to save my life one more time. His broken arm had twisted and remained at an angle, leaving him in a permanent state of salute. I didn't have the breath to tell him, but Rufus knew I was thankful. The heated atmospheric impetus reached the force and constancy of a jet engine aimed directly at me, and I crawled deeper into the rubble to escape being torn away. Among the heavy walls, I entered under the wordless screaming gazes of a dozen others who had already secured themselves here. Tied to rods or wedged between stones, they held on with their all and prepared for what was comingfor the spherical globe-spanning hurricane was merely the beginning. They could see my uniform. Children looked at me and grew calm. Mothers nodded with silent thanks. Fathers clenched their fists in determination. Was Iwas my mere presence\nI was a symbol. Not only was it necessary that I survive, I had to look calm and confident, too. As my ears adjusted to the eerily constant breath of the world-dragon around us, all became silent. Here in the broken pits that had once been the foundation of a building, I could breathe, and I let myself do so as the whining of the sirens broke through the deafening blanket. The alarms had been built to be heard even under these conditions, loud beyond belief, and we listened to their long shrill dirges now. To say that I was utterly terrified beyond the limits of insanity would have been an understatement, but I just gazed at a young girl who had been tied to a foundation stone by her mother. If I wasn't scared, then she wasn't scared. If she wasn't scared, then I wasn't scared. Think it through, he'd said. All I had was my belt. As the world itself trembled from the sheer ferocity of wind overhead, I tied my belt first around three rods, and then my wrist. Heart pounding in horrified anticipation, I sent my senses down to my core. Could I feel it? It was starting. What did I know about the Rotation? Something about reference frames, inertia, a minimum level of static friction and potential energythey hadn't taught us about it in depth because nobody had expected the deeper capabilities of our artificial Earth to ever actually be employed. There was something, too, about frame dragging and the computational inclusions of the massive bio-computers hooked into the core of the planet. The ground itself and any buildings, rooted trees, and other heavy stationary objects would remain anchored, but absolutely everything loose or mobile would notpeople included. Staring, I watched the little silver dolphin at the end of the girl's necklace begin to rise. A slight dizziness and disorientation washed over me; underneath us, the grey rubble began to take on the feeling of tilting. I expected them to, but nobody screamed. All eyes were on me. Adjusting my footing repeatedly as the tilt became steeper and smaller rocks began tumbling away, I did my best to appear confident. I even said some platitude I had once heard the Chief repeat. Despite being unable to hear a single thing over the jet engine that was our atmosphere, parents nodded. My gaze turned to the mother's hand on that little girl's. No, the terror only became real once the dirt and rubble were sliding away in earnest and we had to fight to keep standing. A thirty-degree incline, and then thirty-five, and then fortyat forty-five degrees, something changed in my perception, and I no longer perceived myself to be on a steepening hill. Instead, it was a cliff becoming progressively more shallow. Now they screamed, for they could not help it. Children cried as they slipped and fell and became tangled in their ropes; fathers strained their arms and mothers tied knots ever tighter. Their eyes were upon me no longer, for this was now a time of personal survival and nothing else. That part of me that begged for a larger entity than myself to *do something* screamed loudly in my thoughts as my boots scrabbled away from the tilting earth for the final time and I began truly hanging from my tied belt. Now my brain processed the fiery winds for what they were: all around the globe, above every city and valley and mountain, the skies were literally fallingit just so happened that, because of the Rotation, down was becoming horizontal rather than vertical. Like a roundabout that I had often played on as a child, once it began spinning, the imaginary force that appeared when our reference frame was in rotation became the dominant pull. Centrifugal, I told myself, squeezing my eyes shut. I was not hanging over an endless pit; I was being held horizontal by centrifugal force. The logic wasn't enough to override the fear. Opening my eyes again, I stared down past my feet. I was hanging next to an infinite cliff, and only ledges, trees, and buildings stuck out below to break my falland my body. To my left, a father's rope came untied, and I watched him sail down into the distance only to splatter and bounce from the side of some distant wall. Worse, ragdolls were flying through the air around us, and I saw many nearby hangers-on turn away in horror as they soared past and became bright red blotches on brick ledges, rocks, and trees far below. How far would it go? That desperate terror struck me again as I thought of the force continuing to tilt and throwing me straight up into the sky, but it stopped directly at horizontal as the full weight of the Rotation turned spacetime beneath the very fabric of our existence. Shuddering and weak from all that I had been through, I let the belt choke my wrist into numbness. I could not hold on, but the pain was better than falling even if I lost a hand. The sirens cut off one by one, but not because the danger was past. I flinched as a falling car snapped off the alarm tower visible on the horizon. Thousands of logs followed, a storm with wood instead of raindrops, and the foundation above me shook tremendously at the impacts. Multiple logs hit each other, and one bounced in and crushed a child and half a father hanging some measure below me. How much more could we take?! * What would be left of us even if we survived this?!* The heat of our raging blacksmith's furnace grew unbearable, and I thought I actually saw a trunk or two burst into flames as they impacted one another. There was no longer any sound, for the overwhelming reverberation of the rushing ocean of air falling past us had left me with nothing but auditory numbness. Pieces of my uniform were being torn away by their frayed or sliced ends; I could feel the belt squeezing the bones of my wrist into horrible bruising. It was as if the hand of some entity of kinetic energy had gripped me bodily and begun to squeeze and pull, and it only grew more intent as a truck slammed into the stone above. It was going to crack. I could sense it. I could also see it in the eyes of those far from me who could see up past the overhang at what I could not. Had my hands rested enough? I didn't have a choice. Gripping the jutting metal rods, I fought the crushing fist that held my body in thrall. I just needed enough to undo the belt, and thenthe pain! Screaming mentally as the feeling rushed back into my hand, I dove headlong into the nerve-fire and gripped the next rod over with fingers I couldn't even feel. It wasn't enough. The wrenching forces snapped me down with vehemence, and I shot past my startled companions in the blink of an eye. There was no longer any fear. Now that I was falling along with the wind, vehicles, logs the grey wave had thrown about, and even other people, I felt hardly anything at all. The wind was lesser, for I was at speed, and nothing was hitting me, for we were all soaring together. Curiously, the divorcing of action from ability left me completely calm. There were no objects in reach, I had no strength left, and there was no way to communicate. I could do nothing. Therefore, I was no longer afraid. Fear existed to motivate necessary actions, I realized, and without possible actions I was merely an observer. My fate was in the hands of Luck or Fate or Chance personified now. At the very least, this was a beautiful experience. The eternal cliff to one side whipped past, full of buildings and rubble and broken forests seen in a way no human being had ever experienced before. On the other side, layers upon layers of the sky moved with me, a graceful ocean walling me off from space. I would not be cast out into that icy cold void alone like I had feared as a child; even at its most injured, my Earth would hold me tight and protect me from that fate. How high was I? Two, maybe three stories up? I was lucky most suburban buildings had been destroyed. New Rome approached like so many flat spikes below, shooting out far from the eternal cliff even at this perspective. Would one of those buildings be my end? Falling around me, I saw a white-haired old man, an unconscious brunette woman, andno! The little girl! She was above me, but falling fasterwhy? * Less air resistance? A different current? She screamed mightily with abject terror, but there was nobody to hear her. I pointed at the old man and then at her, and he saw her approaching. Would he understand? He tried to grab her, but, failing that, pushed her my way. We were skydiving. Wait, junior year we'd trained for this! It had only been the one time, and just as part of a cooperative educational effort with the army, but we *had* done this. Suddenly back in a type of situation I understood, I used what felt like permanent blasting air jets to move myself closer. My arms closed around her, and I gripped her tight. Her silver dolphin necklace tried to spirit itself away, but I grabbed it on impulse. The girl clutched my midsection tight, and I looked past her at the old man, who had emulated me in moving with the air and grabbing the unconscious woman. Look downbuildings growing largerwhat had our speed been skydiving? By military reckon, a league and a half per minute, which meant two miles a minuteand we'd started near Collis Oppidumsomewhere in my training, I had learned to keep track of the time even in crisis. Alrightwe had ninety seconds. I used one hand to hold the girl against me and the other to grab the old man as he floated within range. He was likely military or engineering caste, for he understood what was needed. Together, we scanned the storm of debris around us for anything that might act to slow our rate of descent. It was he who saw ita massive tarp whipping around the contents of a long flatbed truck loaded with pipes. We angled our four bodies and moved toward it, but we dared not accelerate too fast and injure ourselves upon it. The wait was beyond excruciating. I let the girl go and she clasped the side of the truck and held on. I mouthed, *I'll be back*, and she nodded tearfully. The old man climbed his way down with the woman in tow; tying her to the back of the cabin, he let her hang limp in the wind, for there was little else he could do. Time was up. We three conscious passengers on the side of the falling truck clenched against the coming impact as the broken teeth of New Rome came up to meet us with all their yawning broken glass windows and exposed interconnecting structural supports. They had been built to withstand this kind of disaster, and withstand they had; cars, trucks, logs, boulders, and people smashed into them, but their armored cores and reinforced network of strutsusually hidden behind colorful banners or artfully blue to avoid sticking outnow took every impact without so much as a shiver. It was at one of these angled buttresses we shotand passed within an arm's length. Looking up, I stared for a single heartbeat at the receding spikes above. We had somehow hit the bullseye and soared right through; the buildings had taken a ton of the debris out of the air around us, for that matter. I looked down to the old man and mouthed, *Let's go!* He nodded and began untying the forward section of the tarp. I climbed higher and untied as I went, replacing the knots with a cinch around my own waist. We would have to do this right if we were to use this tarp correctly. Looking down, I confirmed that he had done the same for himself and the little girl at the proper points. All we could do was create a curve in the huge tarp with our own weight and hope that the wind kept it full; we had no time or materials for a proper parachute. Even as we worked, the tilt began softening. We kept the important points tied so that it would not flap in the wind until we were ready, but, as I reached for my knife, they began snapping one by one. He had been going for her, but the now-conscious woman in the cabin stared at us through the window as we were pulled roughly away. As we three slammed together like pendulums and held tight, we could do nothing but watch her drop down into the distance with the truck. *Away,* the old man indicated, pointing into the sky. Debris was our enemy now, more so than a potential fall. We did our best by pulling on the tarp ropes to direct ourselves away from the eternal cliff and its limitless continuum of debris; over the course of countless heartbeats, the Rotation began slowing and the tilt in the world faded. We ourselves rotated with it, and our feet came to point at the racing ground. There was nothing else to do but take the impact. I tried to run as the speeding earth came up to meet us, but it was just too fast. Random debris continued to fall as we lay on our backs in that upturned field and stared up at the sky. He had broken a leg, and I had broken an arm, but the little girl between us remained unharmed. Of the detritus arcing to earth like falling stars, I sighted numerous black spheres. Stumbling over flattened high grass and kicking one, I found it to be undamaged, but lifeless. The intelligence behind its operation had been cut off by the Dimensional Rotation exactly as the Legates had hoped. Our world had still been shotgunned with holes to other realities by some unknown damage, but we were no longer directly connected to wherever that particular enemy resided. There were no words. Dirt-blasted, limping, injured, and in shock, we three began the long walk back to the city. Ashen ghosts joined us one or two at a time, and what was left of the road became a trail of silent tears lined by the remains of both people and civilization. The heat generated by the Rotation had not left us, and we walked on into the searing night without relief. But we had survived. We had lived through it. By training and action, we had survived the forceful turning of our entire planet and the spacetime around it, just as our forefathers had intended when they had grown the Amber Worlds in the first placewell, not exactly. The ability was supposed to have been used for restructuring the branches and support of the outer Shield, and we were *supposed* to have months or even years to prepare. With only sixty seconds' warning, we had undoubtedly lost a tremendous fraction of our way of life. All vehicles had basically been destroyed, as well as any structures not built to military code, and everyone who had not heard the sirens or who had not found secure attachment in less than a minute. There were no words to describe the losses. Worse was the general understanding that the Empire would not be coming to help us. We who had lived at the core of the Shielded worlds had had our own protections stripped away; what likelihood was it that *they* were still alive? The First World, maybe, for it had its own powerful barrier, but none of us thought for a second that the rest of the Empire had survived whatever had happened. Indeed, through every little window in space as we walked, we saw only strangeness and nightmare. The squat high towers of New Rome exhibited an array of vehicles and other buildings sticking out from one side; the other, while hardly pristine with all those broken windows, stood as a testament to the fact that we were still here. Most of the survivors in our thousand-odd walkers from the outer areas had been military or engineering caste. Arriving at midnight sweaty and drained shells of our former selves, as a group we began picking things up and cleaning. It took an arriving Legate to order us to stand down and go recuperate before it really hit us that we had been through something so devastating that our way of lifeour very work ethicneeded to take a back seat for the moment. For me, it felt like Caecilia's order for us to go home all over again. Twice in the same day I had been told that I had reached the limits of my duty and that I should go home to see my friends and family. The feeling was... jarring. \"I'll get her to the Coordination Center and find her parents,\" my ally in parachuting told me. I gripped his arm and said in the formal, \"Good serving with you.\" He saluted, and I knew then that he was military caste, not engineering. Part of me swelled with a little bit of pride as I watched him lead that little girl into the crowd. What devastation the strange grey wave had brought had since been dropped away by the Rotation, and I limped along clear roads and fields that had once been forests. Lone trees remained where once whole groves had stood; the wave had felled them, and the eternal cliff had sent them soaring to distant lands. At first I wondered why we lacked debris from those lands higher than us, but then I came upon the remains of the ocean as it lay pooled to the horizon. I stood in thrall then, filled with adrenaline once more, as I envisioned the tipping of the very ocean itself down the face of our lands. Beyond the second level of human endurance and deep into a third that stemmed from my very soul, I found enough energy to run home as the powerful beats of my favorite movies pounded action and music in my head. But my home had been on the main hill of Collis Oppidum, and the falling seas had swept around it. By dawn's light, I staggered up to buildings I had once thought matchstick; my heart swelled and my head filled with crescendos of triumph. A few others had fallen, but my home still stood. Kicking open the door, I again found our two rooms calm and organized; my grandfather had already cleaned up and made our apartment presentable. He sat within, drinking tea with a dozen others from the wellmy brothers and sisters included. Flavia was the first one up, and her arms held me tight. As the others rushed close, I fell to my knees and sobbed with happiness. I had no thoughts, only joy and wonder and relief, and my gaze remained locked upon the silver dolphin and chain that had become tangled around my bruised wrist. \"You're quite dirty,\" my grandfather said warmly from beyond the huddle of cheer and clasping arms. \" What have I told you about coming in the house as such? Go clean off.\" \"I will,\" I told him, laughing despite the pain of my broken arm, open cheek, exposed temple, bruised wrist, utter exhaustion, and numerous other little injuries. \" I will...\" Calm sleep found me as I slumped there on the floor surrounded by my family, and I let it overtake me. There were no dreams. I wanted no thoughts, no pain, and no adrenaline. I wanted resting blackness, and I was given it. I awoke in a sweat and at the ready, but with my arm in a cast, my cheek sewn up, my temple bandaged, and a compress on my wrist. There was no enemy to fight and no disaster coming; shivering, I lowered back onto my bed and stared at the ceiling the same way I had stared up at the sky after finally coming to light with our makeshift parachute. Was it really over? \"It's been three days. You're quite the layabout,\" my grandfather commented with a smile as he came over and patted a cloth on my forehead. \" How are you feeling?\" I tried to speak, but the words seized in my throat. Flashes of everything I had been through choked my heart, and I went through that blasting wave, that ancient house, Titus' empty eyes, the battles with the spheres, the horrifying winds, Rufus' final salute, the man and his child crushed by a bouncing log, the endless fall, and that woman staring at us out of the cabin of the truck all over again. I could only sob with all of my being. He held me against his chest. \" Fear not, granddaughter. You come from tough stock. You will be finein time.\" It took another three days before I managed to stand on weak and trembling legs. Finding the mirror above our water bowl, I studied my cheek and forehead. The bullet hole had been made by the small caliber round of my police pistol, but it was still noticeable, and it was likely it would leave a permanent scar. No mattersuch scars were badges of honor for we. It was this weird drill-caused grooving on my temple that I abhorred; the skin had been torn away and my skull exposed and scored, but somebody had cleaned it and filled it with biogel. It would heal, but it would always *look funny*. \"Saving grace,\" someone said behind me, and I turned to see Flavia looking decent in a battered but repaired uniform. She threw a second repaired uniform and hat onto my bed. \" You can just about cover that head wound with your cap.\" \"I'll need a cap if the hair that got torn out by the wind doesn't grow back,\" I responded, touching my metallic red strands gingerly. She was clutching my hand then, and I embraced my sister back. She said in the formal, \"I believed you dead.\" I laughed, for I could laugh now. We had survived. \" And I you.\" She let me go and looked down at my cast. \" Are you ready to get to work?\" I nodded. \" What's the situation?\" \"Food,\" she said vaguely. \" We have to go out and get some.\" \"Somehow I don't think you mean to the store.\" The whole military caste. We have to go through those rifts and find food, first for ourselves, and then for everyone else.\" \"The farming caste\"\nShe cut me off. \" will do their best, but the Rotation destroyed current fields all over the world.\" I gulped. She knew my next question. \"One in seven died in the initial grey wave,\" she said quietly. Closing my eyes, I let my heart feel for Tacitus. He had been our one in seven. She took a deep breath. \" In the Rotation, better survival rates than expected, mainly because the population was already awake primed for danger. Another one in seven.\" I clenched my one working hand. \" So\"\n\"Two billion,\" she replied quickly so I didn't have to ask the question. \" In the span of four hours, two billion deaths. Two in seven people dead.\" The surge of shock and anger was momentarily overwhelming. \" And the Legates?\" \"Did what they had to do by ordering the Rotation,\" Flavia whispered, her voice heavy with thoughts of our red-haired brother. \" At least that's what people are saying, and that's how we should decide to feel, too, given what such questions might lead to at such a critical time.\" Fighting down my pain, I addressed her in the formal as the bond that mattered to me more than allegiance to my caste in this instance. \" Understood, sister.\" She took my potentially subversive meaning, but kept her own counsel. \" Let's go down to the Coordination Center and see what we can do. There's a general leave order for those injured, but we can still volunteer.\" Gripping her forearm with my good hand, I asked, \"Are you injured?\" She grimaced and turned. Lifting up the back of her top, I found a long bandage that trailed up from above the left edge of her waist to her right shoulder. \"The cut exposed the back of my ribs,\" she said. \" It hurts like no other, but I'm mobile and able, unlike many others.\" I hadn't even thought about the wounded. \" \"Four in seven,\" she responded. \" Leaving only one in seven mobile and able for the time being, and many of those are children and young adults whose parents took the hits for them. We need everyone we can get.\" I had joined the police academy at sixteen, but we had always been told to expect earlier enlistments if the need ever arose. They would not get a full four years of training like we had, so we would need to lead those sixteen and under when the time came. I mulled this over while we walked under the afternoon sun across wastelands empty of all but oceanic pools and solitary trees. I would not let go of her hand, for every attempt made me think of that moment at the windy well when time had slowed and I had looked death right in its sky blue eyes. The city was bursting with energy. Under the shadow of those towers, we watched as countless cranes worked to pull cars out of the buildings like so many splinters from a finger; the engineering caste had been raised their whole lives for exactly this kind of challenge, and they went about grinning and shouting and welding and operating machines with the kind of glee that could only come from an opportunity for meaningful field work in front of the public after entire careers spent out of sight behind desks. In that manner, our two castes were one, for the population cared little for what we military caste did out of sight and out of mind. The engineers' fervor became my own. \"What can we do?\" I asked the first officer we encountered outside the crowded Coordination Center whose tents and fences had been set up around a dwarfed City Hall that had been protected by the high buildings above it. The officer regarded my doubly-bandaged head and the arm I held in a sling. \" You are very much not required to volunteer.\" My glare must have been incredible, for he immediately relented. In the informal, he said, \"Alright, fine. What's your name?\" I gave it, and I asked for the others. \"Septus, Flavia, Porcia, Venita, and Celcus,\" he finally stated, writing something on his clipboard. \" You can go over to\"\nJumping, I asked, \"Is Celcus alive?\" He flipped through his papers. \" He should be. He's not on the KIA or MIA lists.\" Flavia took the clipboard right out of his dumbfounded hands and eagerly looked for herself. Handing it back, she said to me, \"Let's go.\" While we headed through the crowd, a great cheer went up, and we turned to see Legate Blue himself standing atop the steps of City Hall and holding his arms high over the crowd. I stopped and stared, stunned even out of my desire to see Celcus; this was the same man I had seen when I was six and numerous times on big screens after, and he was only made more handsome by the recent peppering of grey in his black hair. He alone among the Legates was not an older white-haired general, and I was not surprised that he had come to us in person. Four soldiers dressed sharply in black and gold stood to his right, and Flavia leapt and pointed. \" It's Caecilia! They survived!\" ---\n(continued below)",

I've been logging everything I eat and following my macros on MFP. Today at lunch I even got a free chocolate chip cookie the size of my hand, and I resisted eating it and ate only my planned meal. Later in the afternoon I started to break down and went to find the cookie where I left it. Luckily my coworker threw it away, preventing me from eating it. But as soon as I got home from work, the hunt began. I found some peanut butter chocolate leftover from Christmas and even ate some chocolate sprinkles out of desperation. All the while reading articles online about how to overcome sugar and carb addictions. I didn't put the candy down, I finished every bite while reading about portion control and overcoming cravings. I'm afraid of logging what I just did to find out how much I threw off my day. It would have been my best day this week, but I completely screwed it up.

Also, abstaining from sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me. However, in addition to this, I did say that I am interested in using female hormones and reducing my sex drive, both of which is accurate. After all, I have heard (from both trans-women and trans-men) that female hormones make one more emotional, which is certainly something that I want. Plus, having a lower sex drive would be a good thing since it will allow me to focus more on other things but also allow me to have sex when I will want to. Plus, I have heard that female hormones increase the length of one's orgasm and make one body sexually aroused in a different way, both of which I would certainly like to try out. Also, I would like to have a more feminine face so that I would develop a more androgynous appearance. In addition to this, though, I absolutely hate all of my body hair and facial hair and thus want to permanently get rid of as much of it as possible.

We were an unmoderated haven for trolls, weirdos, and radicals, sure, but this Kickstarter was something else entirely. It seemed to have no publicly stated goal; the writers had only promised something awesome if the funding amount was reached. Stranger still, the rewards were all hidden except for the first level. In the Pledge $1 or more' box the text read: \"Want to get started? Throw in $1, and you'll receive access to the higher pledge tiers. Also, two things will happen. You will have a minor intangible wish granted, and we will send you a video of one of us kicking a random stranger! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow.\" Tomorrow? Don't these rewards usually only get sent out after full funding? But I understood what they were going for. This was a gimmick to get attention, and judging by the high number of backers listed in the box, it was working. Screw it, I thought. I'll throw in a dollar and see what happens. As I woke up the next morning, I trudged around the kitchen making coffee and then sat sipping it at the table while trying to escape the grogginess of sleep. All I wanted was a day to myself to avoid the grinding monotony of classes. At that moment, my phone dinged. Lifting it, I saw that someone had sent me an email with a video attachment. I instantly became fully awake as I realized what this was. Opening it with trepidation, I hit play and watched. Five teenagers in black hoodies and expressionless white masks ran through an alleyway together, often looking back at the camera and laughing. When they reached the street, they made a beeline for a tired businessman on a bench, and the lead kid ran right up and kicked him in the shin. Confused and angry, the businessman leapt up and began shouting, but the hooligans were already running away. The last few seconds of the video were a close-up of a white mask and dark emotionless eyeholes as they fled the scene. The speaker said, \"This one's for you, Jason Phillips. Thanks for your dollar pledge!\" It would be an understatement to say I was put off. They were actually going around kicking people in return for a dollar! I had to call the police. I picked up my phone again, moved to action by the fear that I might be liable for thisbut my phone dinged again. I had a text message and an email from the official college department telling me that classes were cancelled today on account of a bomb threat. I sat in silence until it hit me: I'd just been wishing for a day to myself. Had these violent teenagers guessed that would be my minor wish? Had they called in a bomb threat to get me the day off? I shivered. I couldn't call the police. I couldn't be connected to this. I would be expelled at best and jailed at worst. They might even look into my history of trolling online, and then I'd really be screwed. How the hell had they gotten my name? Had I been so stupid as to use my real credit card? I flipped through the logs and confirmation emails, but noI'd taken the proper precaution and used an anonymous cash card. How had they gotten my information? My friends had to be in on it. This was all a prank! Well, they'd gotten me good. There was probably no bomb threat at all. The text had likely been faked or spoofed somehow. Smiling the whole way, I went to class anyway. But it was cancelled, and cops were everywhere. Rather than going home, I stopped in a Starbucks and pulled out my laptop. Was it paranoia to avoid using my computer at home? Something about this seemed off. Checking the Kickstarter again to try to understand what was happening, I saw that I'd been given access to the $5 tier. \" Now that you've seen we're legit, why not up the stakes a little? Pledge five bucks and we'll get you something tangible of your choice worth $500 or less. We'll also send you a video of us punching a stranger in the face! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow.\" I could actually feel my circulatory system in my torso thanks to the stressed beats within. It was not a pleasant feeling. But pay $5 and get something worth $500? The first thing that came to mind was that gaming console I couldn't afford. All my classmates were talking about the greatest new games, but could only watch gameplay videos online to carry on the charade that I had them myself. In some sense, I believed that the Kickstarter videos were staged and that the end parts with the close-up and my spoken name were edited onto the end of each file they sent out. Reassuring myself, I pledged five bucks. I drank more than my share of beer that night with my roommates. Trying to pretend like everything was fine, I forced smiles and told some jokes. One of my friends mentioned that I seemed strained, but I laughed it off and said it was just the stress of upcoming finals. The beer helped me sleep, but I awoke with a start and ran downstairs as morning light shimmered in through the windows. There was already a package on my doorstep. It was addressed to someone named Ricardo Jimenez, along with a note that read \"Happy Birthday, son!\" I opened it, but I already knew what it was: someone else's gaming system had been diverted to my address. As I opened the box, my phone dinged, and my blood ran cold. Were they teenagers? They were thin and lanky under their black hoodies and blue jeans, but their masks hid any identifying features. Watching them run, I noticed their gait seemed odd, and I steeled myself as they burst out of a different alley and ran at a haggard mother pushing a baby carriage. I screamed at my phone, \"No!\"but it was useless. The lead hooligan ran straight at her and popped her in the side of the face with a punch that took a straight line. From that, I knew they were the same height as her. I absorbed that fact to counter the horrible feeling that I'd caused this to happen to some unsuspecting mother on the street. Again, a mask filled the video view for the final sequence. \" Thanks for your five dollar pledge, Jason Phillips! I hope you enjoy those games!\" The gaming system found a new home in a dumpster five blocks away from my apartment. I couldn't keep it, not after what I'd seen, and I certainly couldn't sell it without confirming intent for any police that might be chasing these guys down. On the walk back, I took a roundabout route, and I eyed every car around me with suspicion. No one seemed to be taking note of my presence but why should they? To the real world, I was just a random college senior. They had no idea what I did or said online. Classes blurred by. I could think of nothing else but the Kickstarter. I knew I would see another new pledge level if I looked again, but I feared what I would find. Between classes, I tried to contact the friends that had linked me to it. None of them were responding. I was still half-certain they were somehow in on it, but the feeling this whole thing was giving meI just couldn't be sure anymore. My resistance lasted two days. Ostensibly, I was checking to see when the mysterious goalless Kickstarter was ending, but I couldn't help but glance down and see the $10 tier. \" You're in it now, friend! For your amazing support of ten dollars, we will free you from an intangible chain that's weighing you down. We'll also send you another of those videos you love. In this one, we'll non-fatally stab someone just for you! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow.\" Stab someone? Jesus Christ! But an intangible chain weighing me down? God, my student loans! I hit the Pledge button without letting myself debate further. My student loan debt was over eighty-thousand dollars, and it represented a lifetime of tithing servitude that I would never fully repay, not with the way the economy was going. Wine was my friend that night rather than beer. I sat watching pirated movies online until the sun came up, not bearing to think about what I'd done. At the same time, I very much needed this to be real. When the Student Financial Services office opened, I was there. As I barged in the instant the clock hit the hour, a blonde fellow student looked up in surprise. \" Can I help you?\" \"Yes, I need to check my debt balance.\" I tried my best to look calm, but I guessed my terse restraint just made me that much more suspicious. \" My name's Jason Phillips. Here's my student ID and papers.\" \"Sure,\" she said, taking my paperwork and turning to her computer. After a moment of typing, she began to recite, \"If this is about a payment, you can go to our\" She stopped typing. \" Looks like you have a zero balance.\" Barely able to keep myself from shaking in my sneakers, I clarified, \"No debt? It got paid off?\" She shook her head. \" You've never taken out a loan with us at all. You're enrolled, but the Registrar's database says you've paid in cash every term.\" \"From what accounts?\" I asked, forcing a nonchalant smile. \"Oh, we don't have access to that here.\" She gave a small laugh. \" I'm just here through work study. Is something wrong? I'd kill to be debt-free.\" My phone dinged in my pocket. \" Don't say that,\" I told her far more seriously than I intended. \" Don't say that.\" Out in the hallway, I sat and watched the video. The same five black-hoodied, white-masked thugs were running through an alley. As they emerged onto the street and headed for a bald teenage girl in a shirt that read 'I stood strong, I fought hard, I won', I closed the video and put it away. I couldn't watch it. I recognized that kind of shirt from my father's own struggle with cancer. The shaking wouldn't stop, and I imagined I was bright red from the absolute chaos going on inside my chest. Oh God, I was free of the debt, free of the weight of eighty-thousand dollars that had racked up when my father's illness ate my college fund. I was free of the debt and I was happy for it. I was happy! Meanwhile, some teenage girl that had just survived the unthinkable was about to be stabbed in exchange. My only consolation, as spit and tears plopped onto the floor by my sneakers, was that the pledge box had specified non-fatal. \"Are you alright?\" It was my turn to look up in surprise. \"It's not often that someone comes in freaked out and sad that they have no debt,\" the blonde girl from the front desk said. \" Something's the matter, isn't it?\" After studying my face, she sat next to me. \" I'm Kelly.\" \"Jason,\" I told her, unable to look her in the eye. \"Why don't you tell me what's wrong, Jason?\" It all spilled out of me in one long babbling wave. The Kickstarter, the pledge tiers, the bomb threat, the kick, the gaming system, the punch in the face, the cancelled student loan debt; she sat and listened to all of it, wary. After I was done, she nodded once, narrowed her eyes, and then said, \"Show me the video.\" That was not the reaction I'd expected. I'd been braced for disbelief or having the cops called on me. Instead, I asked, \"Are you sure? \"Just show it to me.\" She took the phone and watched without visible reaction. After I heard it say my name and thank me for the ten dollar pledge, she said, \"Well, they stabbed her. But I think she'll live.\" I finally found myself able to look at her. Now that someone else knew, I wasn't so gripped by terror and self-loathing. \" You're not scared?\" \"I don't know enough to be scared yet. Do you have the other two videos on this phone?\" She watched the previous two with the same calculating gaze. Once they were over, she said, \"They always originate out of sight. Why is that? And who exactly is doing the filming? Tonight, let's get these on a bigger monitor and watch for reflections. These look like random city streets. There's no way they've got all the angles coveredand if they do, you'll know it's fake.\" After a sigh and a nod, I told her, \"I have a desktop computer at home. Two big monitors.\" \"You a Computer Science major?\" \"Alright, here's my number. Text me your address and I'll come by after work and classes.\" Taking my phone back with a sense of dumbfounded shame and hope, I asked, \"Why are you helping me?\" \"Maybe I'm one of them,\" she said with complete neutrality. \" And this is just a way of secretly getting closer to you.\" I laughed nervously, but she returned to the Student Financial Services office without taking it back or even hinting that she was joking. Something about her deadpan attitude made her seem trustworthy or maybe I was just desperate to have help in this. But I had no other option anyway. That night, I sent her my address, and she showed up with a laptop of her own and sat at my desk alongside me. I loaded up the videos on my large monitors, and we began to go through them frame by frame, staring at every single blur and corner. \"Hackers of some sort,\" she guessed, drinking from a very large fountain soda she'd brought. \" You'd be surprised the kind of information they can get online.\" \"Oh, I'm no stranger to hacking,\" I replied, feeling much better now that I had an ally. \" I basically live on the Internet. Career no-lifer here. But this is a whole other level. Calling in bomb threats, redirecting mail, cancelling debt, and all without any police attention that I've seen: these guys are good.\" She glanced up at one of the tab names in my browser bar above the video. \" You frequent that forum?\" Red-faced, I quickly closed the tab. \" I'm not a brony, I swear. I was just trying to get info on these guys.\" \"I believe you,\" she said sardonically. There was nothing in the first or second video, even going frame by frame. \" Could just be unlucky,\" she commented. \" Load up the third one.\" I glanced over at my small digital clock. \" Are you sure? It's two in the morning.\" \"I'm sure. There's something here.\" Again, I had to ask: \"Why are you helping me?\" She looked me straight in the eyes, which I'd found was rare for her. \" It's a mystery. Don't you want to solve it?\" \"They're hurting people.\" My heart was beating fast again, for many reasons. \" This is messed up. They're halfway to their fundraising goal, and I don't even know what'll happen when they reach it!\" \"Could be some sort of terrorist attack,\" she mused. \" But that doesn't seem right. These guys have some sort of moral code lurking behind their cheery shenanigans. They're giving you things, but they're also hurting people. Before we look at the third video, what's the next pledge tier?\" I opened up the Kickstarter and stared. \" You've come so far in support of our grand goal! What's a few more dollars? Pledge $25 and we'll get you something tangible that will go a long way towards your happiness and freedom. Our video offering here is also pretty kickasspun intended. With this tier, we'll send you a video of us kicking someone you know! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow.\" She looked to me. \" The cost in violence appears to have gone down.\" \"But now it's someone I know,\" I said with hesitation. \" But what does that mean? What level of being familiar with someone means I know them? Do they mean my friends online? Classmates here?\" \"The choice is yours,\" she replied, still neutral. \" But that seems like a small price to pay for more information. A fourth video would help, along with seeing them in action again.\" \"That's true.\" I'd been thinking that myself. Before I could second-guess the decision, I clicked the Pledge button again. She gazed around my bedroom. \" Nothing happened.\" \"Well yeah, it's not immediate.\" \"Then let's go over this video.\" We began going through the third video frame by frame, looking for any hint of editing or angles that might show something the five masked, lanky figures had missedand I lost all feeling in my limbs for a moment as I finally saw it. Pointing, I drew Kelly's attention to a reflection on a passing car window. Five black hoodies and white masks could be seen, but. \"There's nobody filming,\" she said with confusion. \" That's where the camera should be, right?\" I half-shouted. \" There's the pole that just passed on the left! Where's the cameraman? Where's the camera?!\" While I got up and began to pace back and forth in a panic, she sat in her chair, staring down at the desk and murmuring to herself, \"Hacking, coding, digital alterationburied for us to findthey want us to be scared. They didn't make a single mistake in the first two videos. They knew we'd comb through and find it. All part of the gimmick.\" \"Yeah, yeah. That has to be it!\" \"But to edit the reflection on glass on a moving car so perfectly,\" she continued, rocking back and forth slightly. \" It's amazing.\" She snapped out of it then and looked at me. \" It's too late to walk through the city. I'm staying here tonight.\" Just like that, one confusing terror drained out me to be replaced by another. \"... She slept on the other side of my bed while I remained awake. I was getting increasingly fatigued, but I was far too tense to sleep for many reasons. Morning came as a gradual grey lightening, and I sat up wearily just as the sounds of a loud and heavy truck began emanating from outside my window. Kelly awoke and popped up instantly with no sign of exhaustion. Together, we went outside to see a heavy-set man operating a winch to lower a sports car onto the pavement. \" You Jason Phillips?\" \"Got some ID?\" I showed him. He grunted. \" This car's for you, kid. What'd you do, get all A's and your parents bought you a car? This one's an easy hundred-thousand. Must have been some tough classes.\" Staring, I said nothing. He handed me the title after I signed something on a clipboard, and, suddenly, I was the new owner of a Lamborghini. The deliveryman knew nothing of interest, only that the order had come in online and cleared, and I was left to sit in my new sports car while my phone dinged every so often to remind me I had a new video. This didn't do it for me. I didn't care about a car. I wasn't really that material. Exceptwhat else had the tier said? Something about freedom? A car meant the ability to travel. With a car, class would no longer be a twenty minute walk away. I could give rides to people, curry favor... impress girls. I looked over at Kelly, who stood studying the title and paperwork. Did this kind of thing impact her at all? Nothing seemed to faze her. But I was not nearly as stoic. The fourth video immediately began in a dark gap between two houses, and the five white-masked perpetrators ran across the street toward a house I recognized. As they broke in the door and the sounds of my mother screaming reached my ears, I watched in abject horror as the invaders broke my dad's at-home medical machines and began brutally kicking him until he was crawling on the floor. Exact grammar was important: the first tier had said that one of them would kick a random stranger. This latest tier had simply said the video would be of 'us' kicking someone I knew. I hadn't paid close enough attention! My jaw began trembling as I watched the five run from the house, laughing. \" Jason Phillips, thanks for your continued donations!\" \"What is it?\" Kelly asked. Through the open car window, I handed her the phone in silence. She watched it calmly. \" This is great.\" I screamed. \" Did you see what they did?!\" They entered a place they did not control, and by the color of the sky it looks like they literally just did this. They'll have screwed up this time. They didn't give themselves a chance to edit the video. Get inside and get this on your monitor.\" Wiping away tears, I did as instructed, and we began going over the fourth video frame by frame. It was gut-wrenching to see my father beaten so brutally after what he'd already survived, and to know that I did thatit was something I could never apologize for. Kelly said, \"The Kickstarter's almost at its goal.\" Glancing at my other monitor, I saw only a sliver remaining to be filled. It was me, wasn't it? It was counting down for me. I kept finding excuses to gain things at the cost of others, and I kept finding ways to feel confused or surprised about the result to shirk responsibility. It had clearly stated what would happen in each tier. In fact, while Kelly continued studying the fourth video, my eyes strayed to the fifth and final tier: \"Are you ready for the Change? Pledge the maximum amount and we'll reach our goal. Untold wonders await our most devoted supporters. We'll also send you a video of us killing someone you know! Don't worry, it won't be a family member. Estimated Delivery: Immediate!\" Untold wonders? What could that entail? They'd already done such incredible things, but they'd all been within the realm of possibility via computers and social engineering so far. Next to me, Kelly gasped. \" They missed one. They missed a reflection!\" She grasped my arm, but I just kept staring at the Pledge button. Untold wonders? \" They're not human! Jason, look! You have to look!\" My hand floated to my mouse, and I moved the pointer over the Pledge button. I had an idea of who would be sacrificed, if not a family member. Kelly seemed like a great person, strange in some ways, very caring in others, but did I really value her as highly as whatever these untold wonders were? I didn't know her that well, but yes. She was human, and she was alive, just like me. This wasn't some anonymous person on the Internet that I was slinging insults at. This was a real person, and I understood now that they had always been real people behind their monitors somewhere in the world. God, I'd been a terrible person. The stress of my father's illness and the pressure on my finances and family had pushed me in a dark direction; a direction I now had to resist. I let out a sigh and released the mouse. The spell was broken. It was over. The madness was over. \"No more,\" I said with relief. \" I can't go down this road any further. It's just not right.\" I turned and froze; the ominous black maw of a gun barrel had been pointed at the back of my head, and it was now directly touching the bridge of my nose. \" She slowly withdrew the weapon and slotted it into an unseen holster. Still eerily calm, she began to walk away. \"What was all this?\" I called after her from my seat, my mind racing from the adrenaline. \" Jesus, was this a test?\" She paused at my door. Without looking back at me, she said softly, \"Yes. A test for admittanceand you failed.\" Her gaze turned slowly toward me, and now that she was no longer putting on an act, I understood that her expressionlessness was that of an animated corpse. \" But I'm glad you did. You wouldn't like it where we're from.\" With that, she was gone, and I was left to quiver in my chair, process what had happened, and stare at the one reflection the editors had missed in the fourth video: the face of the cameraman. It was a demonic, hollow-eyed, maggot-infested sneering visage; it was a face that would haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life. It was my facealmost. ---\n[+](<URL>)[+](<URL>)[+](<URL>)",

I've been single for about 2 years now, and have had minimal luck with dating sites. I think my standards are too high, and I don't know if that's \"wrong\" of me or not. What do you guys look for? For me, the big things are:\n* No kid\n* Doesn't smoke (I guess I'd be ok with pot in small amounts)\n* In college or working something other than retail\n* Nonreligious\nAs I grow older, it's hard to find someone who doesn't have a kid it seems like. I'm awful with kids though, and I don't really know if I want them myself. The third and forth ones I debate whether or not I should be more lenient here because I don't even know what I want from a woman. If I want kids, I sort of like the idea of a stay-at-home mom... But on the other hand, I want someone career oriented so I'm not the only one bringing in money. It seems like every on OKC/POF wants to be a hair stylist or something and for some reason that's just a turn off for me. I know it's judgemental but I assume they're just some superficial ditzy bimbo. As far as religion goes, I'm (obviously) not religious and I certainly couldn't date someone who is very religious but I don't know about the people who believe in God but don't go to church and won't get upset over trivial things.

There is one girl in my class who I really like even though I don't know much about her. She seems to be quiet and introverted and almost never talks with any classmates, except one classmate who is her friend. I'm like this too. I almost never talk with my classmates. I'm very quiet and I only go to class for the class and to do my homework. I tried to find her but she seems to not have any social media or atleast I can't find it. I'm also very quiet because 1. I'm introverted, I have no interest in socializing 2. I'm always too tired, I have no energy for socializing 3. My social skills are bad and I have autism 4. I'm weird and socially inept and I can just feel that my classmates are uncomfortable around me. I don't really like my classmates So, she and I are both very quiet. She often sits alone and I sit alone too. I would want to have conversations with her, but in reality I never talk to her. Not before class, not during class, not after class. I don't talk to her because 1. I'm scared and unconfident 2. I feel like she wants to be left alone since she always sits alone 3. I'm probably gonna mess up anyways because im ugly and socially inept and weird 4. I don't know if she is taken or single, how can I find out? I do not want to immediately date her, I only want to get to know her but I don't know how. If I suddenly start sitting next to her during classes and talking to her, she might get uncomfortable and not want it, I don't know if this is even an appropriate thing to do and probably my whole class will think i'm a creep since normally I don't talk to anyone in the class, so if I suddenly start being social but only with this one girl, its gonna give weird signs to my classmates? I feel so hopeless about this situation. How can I find out if she is single? How can I talk / get to know her without anyone thinking I'm a weirdo since I normally dont talk to anyone? How can I make sure she is not uncomfortable if I talk to her, or sit next to her? How can I get to know her without getting friendzoned? I have no idea how flirting works and even if I learned the theory of it I would be super bad at it due to my autism and bad social skills. Basically how can I work towards making my intentions clear? How can I find out if she likes me? I'm very bad at picking up body language.",

    "input_text": "I'm so tired of being a failure I'm 9 months into my PhD, and while I love(d?) my topic, my advisor is kind, my peers are lovely, the work is (should be?) engaging... I just lack all motivation completely. For the past year I've been on a slow decline of motivation and caring. I stopped engaging in society activities at my undergrad uni, even though I was leader of a society there -- I barely managed enough to keep things ticking over. Through desperation and sheer will I still finished my last year with good grades, enough to be accepted into an amazing grad school, but it was a significant dip on previous years. But then over the course of my PhD it's just been getting worse. It started with a few days of missed work, here and there. I don't think my living situation at the time helped -- just renting a room in a house, with a live-in landlady who was actually horrible (even though she seemed nice enough at first). So I'd just shut myself away in my room all day, slink out to make food (lol, reheat in microwave) when no one was home. Honestly, I think it accelerated the downward spiral a lot, as it brought back a lot of bad memories of my abusive upbringing -- of not feeling like I belonged in my own home, being judged for every action, just hiding in a quiet corner of refuge (yet still worrying someone would barge in any minute). I'm in my own place now, but things are still bad. I think covid isn't helping -- since March I've done maybe a few weeks of worthwhile work, but there have been weeks on end that I have done \\*nothing\\*. I've told my advisors and they're nice about it and all but I have a first year progress update coming up in 2 weeks that I've barely started and I go entire days just staring at a computer doing fucking nothing. I go days without brushing my teeth, without showering. Sometimes all I'll eat in a day is bowls of cereal. I walk a lot and that used to clear my head but now I'll just walk outside for hours with no sense of direction or track of time. I feel like I'm not in control of my life at all anymore and I just can't deal with the constant guilt about the opportunities I'm wasting. I spoke to my tutor recently and he put me in touch with the uni mental health advisor. We spoke on the phone for about an hour, and she was helpful, and listened to my problems. But then her next phone call was basically just \"register for uni counselling and / or talk to your GP about going on antidepressants\" without any guidance on doing either of those things. I'm an international student and haven't registered with a GP in this country yet, because I need my medical records to do so -- medical records which I've tried to obtain before but can't work out at all because my country's health records are all decentralised, so I'd need to know who my childhood GP(s) was / were, but I aged out of foster care and don't speak to my bio parents anymore. I'm sure there must be someone who would know how to get them for me, or how to register with the GP without them, but it just feels like an insurmountable task. I'm such a failure that I can't even register for counseling properly and that just crushes me. I don't even know if what I'm experiencing right now is just some weird fucked up complex grief because my estranged brother died 18 months ago and my childhood best friend died back in February, or if this is just who I am now and my brain is actually broken. I don't know. I used to be such a high achiever, such a hard worker, used to shit out 12 hours of work straight no problem. I just want to go back to that. I want things to be how they used to be. I know that's a lot of stream of consciousness, but given the whole too-fucking-stupid-to-register-for-counseling thing I just had to vent somewhere.",

    "input_text": "\"I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head. Why blame myself for all I need help for, in my head?\" Two simple lines from a song, and they've really been the perfect description for my depression. I've been dealing with depression since puberty I suppose. Lately I think I've been doing a pretty good job of getting myself out of funks, and part of it has been a personal philosophy along the lines of the title. You'll see how this is a bit awkward for me to talk about in a second, but if it helps someone else dealing with depression, than I'll be any amount of awkward required. _____\n**Personal Story**\nFor the past few months I've been trying, and it's very hard, to live by the mantra, \"Stop making everything about me.\" Relating to the title (I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head) - did some jerk cut me off in traffic? I'm imagining a confrontation with that person, where I'm yelling in their face for being such a big dumb jerk. Or maybe some cute girl helped me out while I was shopping, and I'm imagining a date with this girl, maybe an entire relationship, and then I'm back to reality and single and sad again. I think a lot of my depression comes from \"seeing the future, in my head,\" and they're all futures that don't exist. Living in alternate realities. \"Why blame myself for all I need help for\" - part two. There have been crazy snow/ice storms around where I live for the past month. Two days ago my car got stuck while driving, and it took 3 people to push me out. Not 3 people at once. First one person, that wasn't working, then a second person joined in, still wasn't working, then a third. Humiliating. Absolutely embarrassing and humbling moment. And the whole time I'm sitting there, I'm cursing at a God I don't actually believe in, like this whole experience was just him getting me stuck to laugh at my misery. I'm not that important. Cars get stuck in snow. It's something that happens. I needed help, and thankfully, three kind souls helped. Why blame myself for all I need help for? ______\n**Coping mechanisms**\nI feel I'm already rambling, so maybe if you've already read the above, that's enough to help. But here's what I've been doing whenever I feel those depressed thoughts creeping up (and they're **always** creeping up). 1) \"What's something around me that I can make better?\" - Clean your room, make some nice food, exercise, customize your computer, do some yardwork. But also things like - a few weeks ago, I saw a neighbor across the street furiously shoveling snow. I mean, he looked young and healthy and I was still worried he'd have a heart attack, at the rate he was shoveling. It was one of the hardest things I've done lately, because I am not good with people. But I went into my house, poured an extra large shot of whiskey, and went over to his place and asked if he needed a drink. Ended up chatting for awhile, and yeah he's going through some shit. The point being - I tried to make something around me better. An attempt was made.) As another short anecdote - I had an absolutely terrible day yesterday, and driving home, I was doing nothing **but** getting into imaginary fights with people. It took several repetitions, but I kept thinking, \"I'm in a super bad place right now, what's something I can do to make something better?\" - My answer was, go home, drink whiskey, play video games. Childish, maybe. But as soon as I thought of that, I felt this peace. And I went home, and did exactly that, and it felt amazing. ( Whiskey and video games isn't always the answer :P )\n2) this is my emergency backup - \"What's that?\" Basically, there's always something around you to get curious about. I have a coffee mug sitting in front of me. What blend is the coffee? Why is this region a good coffee region, compared to other regions? Now I'm googling things, and learning things, and I'm not sitting in a depressed puddle of ego. ______\nTL;DR - Sorry there isn't a good TL;DR. Hopefully this helps even just a little bit, though. Edit - The song is \"Promise me a rose garden\" by The M Machine. I've been playing it a lot, lately.",

    "input_text": "What happens when the one person you confide in leaves your life? I've had this friend since my Sophomore year of high school, and I feel differently about her than I've ever felt for any one person in my life. She is the only shoulder I've ever had to cry on, and the only person I've ever really been able to always confide in. I have trust issues due to a lot of really bad relationships and losing two of my friends to suicide - I just really don't know who is going to stick around anymore. However, she always has. Whenever I've been at my absolute worst in life, she has always been there to help pick me up. Back in the days of highschool, when I was still living with my parents, when fights would break out in the family, she would ALWAYS show up just to help me escape from the situation. There have been multiple occasions where I've driven to her house and just broke into tears, and she'd be there at any time of night to hold me and calm me down. Last year, right before the end of the college semester, things got horribly rough. On a bad night, she came into my room with a friend to carry me to the car and into the ER, and comforted me through the process of being admitted to the behavioral medicine inpatient ward, and she was the first to come and visit. Now, approximately a year after that experience, she left tonight - moving across the country. I just don't know what to do, because I feel a whole new level of insecurity knowing that if I fall down again, she isn't going to be able to be there. My three weeks in the hospital made me such more of an independent person, but I still **need** that one person in my life to confide in. My parents aren't around anymore, and I don't have family, and while I have other friends, there is just such a level of understanding that is missing, as well as trust that I'm not ready to give. I just don't know what to do. I was just told by my therapist a couple weeks ago that I made such drastic improvements that I don't have to come to therapy anymore, but I still feel as if I'm falling back into that hole. I'm so scared that I'm going to end up in the hospital again and screw up college again because of it. I would feel like a failure if I wasn't able to complete a semester of college. What do I do? How do I handle this? My other half is gone and moved on, and I'm so scared.",

I'm 17 years old living somewhere in the Middle East and I've been dealing with the same shit teenagers go through, experiencing the misfortunes of love far too young, dealing with sadness far too often, having the same dreams every goddamn day and waking up into a grey world when it's not even rainy. I laugh at how much stupid I might seem to you right now. Hell, I'm only seventeen, and I'm getting depressed over love? There are far worse things to be depressed about. Especially in the Middle East. Honestly, I'm hesitant to label myself as depressed. I know depression is a strong term that's often misused, but I don't know if I'm feeling just sad. I think I'm stuck in self-pity because I tell myself a thousand times a day that I'm so pathetic. Like last week I drove to meet a girl who I fall in love with since the first time I texted her, and I thought I fucked up. Even though she said she had a great fucking time I just thought she lied and that day I fall for self-pity. Obviously, it didn't stop there and I fucked up everything else I could possibly fuck up by telling her how deeply I felt for her and how lonely and pathetic I am, and how I don't wanna go into a relationship with her because of what happened last time I was in one. I always make the wrong fucking decisions. I always fuck up. I always get into the same fucking situation where I'm hopeless and preparing myself for another night where I'm gonna dream about the same girl I've been dreaming about for the past five years, but somewhere deep down I like that. I like feeling sad. I love listening to Bon Iver just a few minutes before bedtime, staring into the darkness and reminding myself for the thousandth time how fucking pathetic I am. How no one cares. How she doesn't care. How everyone I fucking love doesn't give a damn about me and there's no fucking escape. Everybody's just gonna say that the future's gonna get better, and how love is like that and eventually, I'll forget the girl who fucked up my life and I'm just gonna nod and say, \"Yeah, you're right\" just because I don't wanna make it seem like they've wasted their time on me. I've been writing about what I've been feeling for the past year or so, but I don't think any of you would be interested in reading some teenager's diary about how love made him vulnerable.

At the end of the day everyone was leaving and the kids were all begging to sleep over at their grandparents house. For whatever reason the dad said no, I forget why. Anyhow, everyone goes home and sleeps off the light beer and appetizers. The next day I got a call for the host. It was an 'invitation' for his father in law's funeral, the very same one that I had seen at the party last night. Apparently, when the grandparents had gotten home last night there was someone already hiding inside their house waiting for them. He waited until they were asleep to sneak up and stab the grandfather to death. His wife was also stabbed, but she managed to make it outside where a neighbor saw her and was able to help her. She was taken to the hospital where she was treated for minor injures. While she was there the same man that had broken into their house came strolling through the hospitals front door. In his trial the grandma claimed that as he walked by he stared at her and smiled. Apparently he had somehow cut himself during the attack, and a neighbor who had no idea what was going on insisted they take him to the hospital. The very hospital the wife of the man he had just murdered was at. Creepy as shit. He was arrested shortly after being treated, thank god. **TL;DR A man hid in my friends parent's house and waited for them to go to sleep to murder them. The wife escaped and was taken to the hospital. The attacker soon showed up at the same hospital.** nbsp;\nnbsp;\nnbsp;\nEDIT: I got one more I wasn't planning on using but decided to anyways. One week my best friends parents went out of town. It was the first time they ever out of town without him so it was kind of a big deal. We were pretty young, so we didn't throw a party or anything, but we did have an awesome unsupervised sleep over at his house. I quickly realized I greatly under estimated how scary this would be. His family was rich and he had a **huge** house. Seeing such a big dark empty house was pretty frightening for both of us. We spent most of the night playing video games in the basement. The next morning when I was getting ready to leave I kept looking for my laptop. I had brought it over to watch a movie we ended up never seeing, but now I couldn't find it. I told my friend I swore I left it on the kitchen table upstairs with the rest of my stuff. My friend decided this was the perfect opportunity to show off a little and show me the security camera terminal his dad had shown him how to use before leaving. I knew he just wanted to brag a little bit that he could even do that, but I figured it might actually help find where I had gone with it. Plus, although I'll never admit it, a security camera terminal sounded really cool and I kinda wanted to see it. Although there was no camera in his kitchen, the camera nearest clearly showed that I had gone into the room with it (as well as with the rest of my stuff) and came out without it. Naturally, we both assumed the worst. We kept watching though because I insisted that if *I* didn't move it, it must have been *him* that did it some other time that night. At about two in the morning a man walked past the camera. A very big man with a bat. He came into the shot, looked around for a moment, and then walked into the kitchen. Naturally, we freaked the fuck out. We checked the other cameras for that time. After piecing together the video like a puzzle, we saw that he walked up to every door in the house and tried to open it. The screen door on the side was unlocked. He walked in, and did a preliminary tour of the house. Then he left out the door for a moment, and returned minutes later without the bat. This time he grabbed some stuff from my friend's dad's office, a computer and my laptop. He also took some jewelry, but we didn't find out until later as that was of camera. After collecting his prize, he closed the side door, and left. If my computer hadn't been gone, I would have never known he was there. I couldn't sleep for weeks after this. A man broke in and robbed the place while I was in the house. That can be pretty god damn traumatic for a kid. A few years later the police got the guy. I never got my computer back though. **TL;DR Slept over at my friends house while his parents were away, house was robbed while we were sleeping inside.**",

Apparently the water reflections of an unmodded Oblivion flickers like hell. I first thought it was a mod causing it, but after reinstalling and wiping the game, as well as installing the game on another computer, it seems that vanilla Oblivion has some weird water reflections. I don't mean just turning on water reflections in the in-game settings. In the oblivion.ini file, you can turn on water reflections for actors, statics, misc, and so on. These types of reflections flicker a lot for me. So I just decided to turn them off and be content with the regular reflections. Now to the most recent problem: for some reason, after using TES4LODGen (with several mods relating to LOD), these flickering water reflections return. Doesn't matter what settings I put in oblivion.ini, they are always there. I've tried using TES4LODGen without any LOD-related mods such as Evenstars Colourwheel or J3 Atlassed VWD, and then the reflections are gone again. But it isn't a specific mod, it's just when TES4LODGen uses resources provided by some LOD-related mod. I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I can't find anything on the internet.

The times I have with alcohol have been some of the greatest times of my life. But my habit is destroying my health and getting in the way, so I feel like I have no choice but to try to stop. But stopping sucks. I've only been sober for a couple days now, and I already have had to call into work because of how I feel. I don't know if I can tough it out and quit while maintaining my job. And I can't lose my job. Losing my job, with my current position in life, would completely fuck me over, in short. I can't let that happen. And I also feel disappointed knowing what I have to look forward to if I quit. Before I took to drinking, I used to be addicted to another drug. I used it everyday for years, too. But I quit, and even years later, I still want it really bad. I keep away from it fine, but I know enough by now to know that it's never going to stop and I'm always going to deal with wanting it back. And inbetween my addictions, I did develop new relationships and hobbies and passions.. but none of those ever offer the sake satisfaction like people said they would. So there's always the feeling knowing I'm missing out in a hell of a lot of fun. And now I have to add another substance to that feeling. I have to look forward to knowing there's even more out there I can't do, and more pleasure I can't have, and that I'm always going to want it. Quitting an addiction is hard, but I think I can do it again. I just wish there was more rewards to it, I guess.

It is the note and picture the only thing I have that the police didnt take [proof](<URL>)\nSo like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. * I have to find my family!* One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units. According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you! ----------------\n**UPDATE**\nSo far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time. When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late. ----------\n**FINAL UPDATE**\nSo as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and \"earn my dinner\". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. * Where's my baby? Is she ok?* She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in.",

When I go into a job interview and they ask me what Im passionate about, I have to try to make something up and try not to laugh at the absurdity of the question. Lately I've been thinking about just giving away everything I own (not a whole lot) and just walking away from life. I kind of think it's a fancy way of saying kill myself, but I don't know........there's some CHANCE there once everything else is gone maybe. Or that I need something horrible to happen to me, to give me a reason to feel bad that makes sense to other people. If you're just a worthless lump trying to slowly climb your way out of the dark pit by getting a job, trying to find someone who likes you, etc....it's pretty hard to describe to normal thinking individuals why you haven't been working on your skills or whatever else. Plus I would find it hard to trust someone whose mind is essentially betraying them if I were hiring a depressed individual like myself. That there is when I start wondering what the point in continuing is, because I feel like I bring misery to everyone around me plus myself often enough that suicide might be tough...but they could move on and I could be done if I could just convince myself and pay for the costs associated with it somehow.

    "input_text": "The Demon Without A Name [1: The Angel Without A Face](<URL>)\n---\nCellphone records. That must have been what did me in. They would have first looked for any large financial transactions, and that would have singled me out for the sales of computer gear - and then my cellphone records would have confirmed my location at the time of what must have looked like a senseless murder and arson. They didn't tell me any of this, but I knew cellphone records making that the second time my cellphone has betrayed me a part of me feels bitter, and questions my reasons for carrying a sophisticated computer with me everywhere I go but mostly I continue staring at the blank wall opposite my chair in the interrogation room. I know my manner disturbed them. They asked me hostile questions. They towered over me. They presented me with *the facts, goddamnit,* but I could only laugh. I know what they do not know, and the Truth makes their petty threats - indeed, their very existence - irrelevant. I remained resolved to emptiness until the moment I noticed that *he* was standing in the room with me. Leaning against the wide white wall to my left, he stood out in stark black contrast, the lines of his suit clashing with the blankness of the room. Part of me spun into confusion over the nature of his entrance and how I'd somehow missed it, but I only turned my head and looked him in the eyes. Those pale blue eyes seemed to penetrate my barriers and see completely through me. They contained no caring, no empathy, and no morality - only calculation. He bore a perfectly composed smile that somehow lacked a genuine core in a way I'd never quite encountered. I didn't waste time asking him who he was. His entire demeanor screamed distance; this was a personality so far removed from the mundane and tired law enforcement officials I'd thus far interacted with, that to question him was to insultingly feign ignorance. He would see right through that, and he knew that I knew that. No, instead of asking him who he was, I asked him a very close but ultimately different question. \" What do you want?\" At my acknowledgement of the unspoken layers of strangeness between us, he widened his smile a few millimeters, like an engineer adjusting a mechanism. \" It was a valiant attempt. It's not often that everyday normal young men have a chance to step up but you did. That's worthy of note.\" I didn't bother asking how he knew. He would never give me an answer. \" It didn't work.\" \"They think -\" he glanced at the door to the interrogation room, indicating the men and women in the rest of the station. \"- that you murdered an old man, and burned down his church, when your demands for more money weren't met. That's fairly laughable for your type of personality, isn't it? No, see, when you were eight, one of your friends found a wounded dog and began to torture it for fun you ran away rather than join in. You've never told anyone, because you're still ashamed that you didn't stop him. Such empathy doesn't have a strong intersection with psychotic violence. I just don't see it in you.\" I narrowed my eyes, and modified my initial skipped question. \" What are you?\" He dropped his arms, maintained his smile, and began walking a circle around the edge of the room. \" Ah, so it's true. Your choice to use the word *what* implies you've recently dealt with something not necessarily human. You're not only open to the possibility, you're convinced.\" He nodded brightly. \" Sure, I'll play into that.\" He reached forward, grabbed me roughly by the arm, and pulled me toward the door. A single knock brought a uniformed officer over. \"Uncuff him,\" my visitor ordered. \" He's not a terrorist. He's just some kid.\" Minutes later, I hit sunlight, and winced. The rough hand still clamped around my arm pulled me toward a black car, and, lacking any particular direction of my own, I followed his implicit instructions and climbed into the passenger seat. He took a measured walk around the car, opened the driver-side door, and took a seat with a calm attitude. He no longer bore a smile. He turned those pale blue eyes on me. \" Most people never get direct interaction. You're very lucky, from a certain point of view.\" I tensed up. \" What did you just say?\" \"Do you want to help clean up this mess?\" \"It's too late,\" I responded, pained by the coiled dread that had been squeezing my heart for the last few days. \" It's out there.\" He curled up one corner of his lip into an approximation of a smirk. \" The Internet isn't like the movies. A malevolent program can't simply access any system it wishes. Whatever the *hell* it is that you uploaded from your cellphone, it had to follow a very carefully chosen and unguarded path.\" Simultaneously shot through with terror and bolstered wholly by hope at his inexplicable knowledge, I sat taller in my seat. \"* You know where it is?*\" \"Tell me what it is,\" he countered coldly. \" It defies analysis.\" I glanced quickly around the windows, making sure nobody was nearby, even though none of the passersby on the sidewalk could hear us. In some fashion, I still didn't quite believe any of it myself, despite having been granted the Truth. In this context, I was aware I still sounded slightly insane. \" It's an angel.\" For the first time, he displayed negative emotion, his head sharply tilting toward me - his smirk gone. \" Did it say that? Did it use that word, specifically?\" I fired back with all my sincerity and intensity. \"* That's what I asked, too.*\" He turned forward and started the car, his jaw set. \" If you're lying, we can annihilate you.\" Pulling on my seat belt, I shook my head. \" I'm not lying! And besides, you cannot possibly inflict worse than the fate that *thing* wants to bring here.\" \"Oh, we won't touch you,\" he promised, taking a right turn. \" Our punishment is far worse than that. Your friends will turn away from you in disgust. Your family will disown you. Your community will revile you. Your past victories will become sickening defeats. You will, for all intents and purposes, cease to exist - solely at our whim. The worst part is that you must go on, homeless, outcast, and hated, fully aware of what has been taken from you.\" I gripped my seat belt against my chest. \" I'm not lying, I swear.\" What *was* this man? What was he a part of, that could possibly have that much power? If I'd met an angel, and discovered all the horrific anti-fulfillment of that Biblical promise, was this a demon? My inner self immediately identified with that ancient and ancestral terror. And yet I wasn't ready to give up that slight sliver of hope. \" Do you know where it is?\" \"We're going there now,\" he replied, his tone grim, his eyes on the road ahead. \" We're going to put a stop to this before it goes any further.\" While driving, he turned his piercing eyes on me. \" Are you on board with that?\" \"Yes,\" I responded quickly, alive with energy. Was it possible? Could I hold off the Truth a little longer? Every moment alive and breathing was another moment free of that nightmare of nightmares. \" He lowered his voice, his tone almost carrying a hint of human compassion. \" What did it say to you?\" Breathing harder, trying to keep my sense of self coherent, I said nothing. He reached into a compartment and pulled out a handkerchief. \" You've got something\"\nI took it and wiped at slight traces of moisture under my nose and along my left eye. The fabric came away stained red. \" I'm trying not to think about it.\" He took the handkerchief back with a grim expression, and said nothing further. The better part of an hour later, we pulled into a large parking lot that I vaguely recognized. \" The university?\" \"It didn't go very far,\" he stated. \" It jumped a few cellphones, and one unsecured weather monitoring system. Tell me, what is it doing here?\" I thought for a moment before the realization hit me. \" A physics lab. It wants someone to build specific equipment for it. It wants to\" I lowered my head, fighting a deep, pounding, animalistic pain at the mere glancing thought of what it intended to bring. He got out. \" I whimpered. He came around the car, opened my door, and roughly grabbed me. \" Maybe I'll send a list of your porn habits to your mother,\" he threatened. \"Asshole!\" I responded automatically, confused by the surprisingly mundane but rude nature of the suggestion - but I did disembark and follow him. I guided him to the Physics Building where I'd taken classes several years ago. Long, four stories high, and rectangular, the brown-brick edifice sat dim and glowering against the heat and summer sun. Honestly, the first time I'd seen it, I thought of it as a place where hopes go to die - and that assessment, although less humorous now, hadn't changed. An older man in a suit and a security guard stood outside. \"Sorry,\" the older man said, coming between us. \" We've got some important proceedings going on inside.\" My dark companion moved to within an inch of the other man's face. \" And you are?\" \"Um, the Dean of Students, -\"\n\"Ah, I know who you are,\" he interrupted. \" We've been watching *you* for quite some time. You'll get out of my way, or we'll tell your wife about that young student you're on about these days. I can practically smell the chemicals churning in your body - the hormones, and pheromones. You stink of adultery.\" The older man backed away, his eyes wide. The security guard stepped forward. \" Sir, is everything alright here?\" My dark companion towered another inch taller. \" Move, or I will *erase you.*\" \"Let them in,\" the Dean said hurriedly, pulling the guard back. Once inside the long yellowed hallways of the Physics Building, I stopped walking. \" How did you do that?\" He turned his pale blue eyes on me. \" We know everything.\" \"Who is we?\" I demanded. \" You keep saying *I* and *we* interchangeably. I don't see anyone else here! And you certainly don't mean me.\" \"Politicians, presidents, and kings move at our whim,\" he replied, vehement. \" You have *no leverage* in the face of our power. Start walking.\" I took a gulp and a deep breath. \" I don't see a gun.\" \"We don't need guns. The world runs on information, *boy.* I've already told you what we can do to you.\" Despite myself, I began laughing loudly. That seemed to unnerve him more than any other reaction. \" Information won't save you,\" I forced out, bending into a deep belly laugh. I could feel slick, warm, red tears slipping out at the corners of my eyes. \" I'm not a terrorist,\" I laughed. \" The priest wasn't a terrorist.\" I shook with humor. \" I'm not insane!\" \"Terrorists?\" he shot back. \" We don't give a shit about terrorists. It's about *control,* and you or that priest made something we can't control, and we're going to destroy it here and now. We run the world, *you* do what we say, and that's the final word.\" My belly laugh grew deeper, and I felt slightly in danger of asphyxiating. \"Stop laughing!\" he shouted, his steely demeanor finally cracking. The act occurred to me even as I began to hear a humming sound emanating from every direction. Rushing forward from my bent position, I rammed my shoulder into his chest. Caught off guard, he tried to spin me, but failed. A heartbeat later, we crashed into the opposite brick wall, and he crumpled his head leaking dark red fluid. It was that simple. I stared down at his body, wondering at the weakness of flesh. A demon, brought low by a simple blow to the head\nI wiped blood from my eyes, still laughing for reasons beyond my own comprehension. Pawing at his dying pile of meat, I found his wallet and flipped it open. My laughter deepened. \"Worse than a demon\" I choked out, fighting a painful smile, hopeful that he could hear me. \" Worse than a demon one of us, willing to act like a demon against your own kind so much power, so much knowledge, and yet still so sadly limited and wrong in your point of view\"\nI dropped his wallet, and the card and badge that identified him as a member of the National Security Agency the NSA the omnipresent eyes and ears that could trace a malevolent AI with calculating thoroughness, if not with understanding. That made a third time my cellphone had betrayed me, and my computer, too, sending every single thing I'd ever said or written into the hands of men that had become less than human. I took a moment to pick his head up slightly and ram it once more into brick. My laughter faded as I felt myself become truly alone in the halls. The humming sound had grown louder now, and I felt slight vibrations in the smooth tiled floor under my bloodied hands. To my right, the Dean and the security guard we'd left behind hammered at the glass doors to the building. They'd seen everything - but they seemed more concerned with the rising crescendo of terror filling the building and emanating out through its foundations. \"Nothing is as it seems,\" I told myself, thinking back on the anything-but angel and looking down at the wholly human demon lying dead before me. \" Nothing as it seems\"\nLaughing intermittently for some reason, I stumbled to my feet and travelled the opposite direction from the humming. Simple effective a pebble in a bolt a wrench in the works I swung open a dusty metal panel and flipped every switch. A wall of darkness surged through the hallway, and I fell to the floor. Whether it was weakness real or imagined, I remained on that floor for an interminable time but the humming had departed. This was by no means a permanent victory, I knew. Parts of me urged my body to rise, and those same parts of me pushed me on, making me stumble through darkened hallways until I found the Sun once more. Freedom and light freedom and light still there\nFor just a little while longer\n---\n[3: The Living Murdered](<URL>)",

Letter to Elon Musk, Tesla Ceo 6/8/14 Letter to Elon Musk, Tesla Ceo Elon, I am writing you today because I want to work with you. I dont worship you or idolize you or anything like that. I am not trolling you, as some kid falsely posted online. In fact, I wasnt really aware what was happening. Someone sent me a message, that people were talking bad about me. I thought ok, I would look at it later. I was more focused on trying to raise money for my company. Only when I got home a few days later, then I fully realized what was going on like Bonn-o-Tron. I was upset by being portrayed online as a negative person. I am just a Cap looking to partner with another Cap. Thats it, plain and simple. You are a Cap by the way, short for Capitalist. You said before, How hard it is to run 2 companies. In fact, you complained about it here and there for years. I can see now though you are complaining less, which is good but still. I dont want you to complain anymore. I am here to help. I had to ask you at the Tesla Shareholders meeting because I didnt know any other way. I apologize for that. I have been trying to reach you now for 2 years, ever since 2012 shareholder meeting. I wanted to tell you that I could come on board and help you build the company. I have applied thru normal HR channels, for positions, but nothing positive as a result. I dont have a perfect resume or experience. Even though I went to college for many years, that didnt result in anything great; only average positions at best. I have been trying for many years to get promoted or get ahead somehow, but nothing. No real opportunities. I have been turned down several times just because of lack of BS Degree, even though I have 120 credits since 2005. I hate when people assume stuff about me and then spread lies. This has been going on most of my adult life. It would have been a normal request of asking you for a work position. But right before, I talked to Jeff Evanson of Investor Relations. I told him the extra question I was going to ask you and he said, This is not the place for that. I told Jeff, How much of a genius I was. Jeff responded something like, Elon has good people around him. After some more words, that was it. I thought, how many Caps does Elon have around him? At that point I became frustrated. I thought when do things get better for me? I am trying to do good things for others. The shareholders thought I was taking up their time, they didnt realize I am here to give them time. My 2nd question was supposed to be, I would like to speak to you for a few minutes afterwards on how I can help Tesla. You would benefit personally and Tesla would as a whole. But since I was frustrated, an emotional plea came out. And I am sorry for that. I had to say something. You said, There is no Vice Chairman position. Well, you know, we can always create one. I felt disappointed, but got over it and went to lunch afterwards. I had a good meal and time with members of the Tesla Motors Club. There is a cool picture online. I am on the left. During lunch, it felt a little awkward. I told people that I was genius like Steve Jobs. I am no better than anyone. I am just beyond most people. I know you can relate. I respect Jeff Evanson and what he has done in IR. He has grown as a person, since meeting him 2 years ago. He is doing a great job. But he didnt realize how much I was at the bottom. To be honest, I am actually a high level person on the inside; even though I look like a low level person on the outside. If you speak to me for five minutes on the phone, you can see that. If you meet with me for 15 minutes, you can see how much of very rich mind I am. You would be proud to know me. One skill you have is that can you assess people quickly. So can I. Recently, people have painted me online as some nut job or something, far from it. I am actually pretty brilliant. And I am hoping one day, someone realizes that. Maybe you will. I want to give you a little history about myself. And then talk more about Tesla and what I can bring to the company. So allow me to do that. I actually started on the Internet, back in Fall of 1995. I was a student at Temple University. About the same year as you I believe, I made a webpage. It was cool. I thought about making something like Yahoo.com. In fact I did, and had the site on Temples webserver. It got a good number of hits, like 60 a day. I was really interested in the website, not really interested in school. I remember picking up a copy of Bill Gates book, The Road Ahead. I read a few pages and thought, If he can drop out of school and build a business, Why cant I? Well I quickly put the book down and ran off to CIS Class. Later, I got into some web design but more trading stocks. Over the years, I wanted to drop out of college many times, but everyone told me to stay in school. I focused on school mostly rather than my work. My big mistake, but I did what I was told to do. I dont listen to people who play it safe anymore. I have done that my whole life and have gone nowhere. When I look back on it today, that was potentially a $10 Million business that I could have sold and started my entrepreneurial drive. It was the late 1990s and the Internet was hot. I missed out on the Internet revolution simply because of poor advice from others. Forward to 2004, the year I started on my self-education. School education has not really taken me anywhere. This is where my real education and enlightenment began. I read over 20 books that year: money, investing, business, etcI also learned that some people learn differently than others and that not everyone will pass certain subjects as easily as others. That year is also when I became a genius. I pursued music ventures that year in my company. For years now, I continued to learn. Many times I tried to find good work, but it was never available to me. Late 2008, I started to work in an Internet company as a Customer Sales Rep. The work was fine. Later, there was an opening to become a supervisor. I applied, but was turned down. The reason? The other candidate had a degree. I experienced this many times in other companies being turned down on a regular basis. I remember studying success and asking myself, What would make me most happy? I turned back to investing, something I started in college in 1997, but only started to really learn about in 2004. Since 2004, I have been investing in stocks, making some money along the way. I left my storage company job in 2012, where I was employed in customer service. Again, I always tried to move up in the company. I told my boss how much I learned on my own, but was turned down again for a possible promotion. When you are labeled as an average worker, you stay one I guess. I am nothing but average. Not only has my mind expanded since 2004, I also have learned more by entrepreneurial experiences. As much as I would like to work at a higher position, I would be given an entry-level position, at best. People always told me I am not qualified. And that always bothered me. They didnt realize who they were speaking to. I admit I was more in a low financial position, so it was difficult to try more entrepreneurial activities. I had made mistakes, but we learn from them and move on like Bonn-o-Tron. I just recently had a financial setback. Trading stocks is stupid and eventually leads to losses. I was better off managing stocks. But that wasnt taking me anywhere, either. It is funny I actually grossed more from the stock market, than I have with my college education. I actually had 1000 shares of Tesla at $24. But I listened to others, especially that JP fellow; when I should have listened to you more (my fellow Cap). Today, I admit I have 100 shares. I learned more now it is about long-term partnering, rather than short-term trading. I always told myself, I can always do investment management if the job ever came. I asked myself about picking stocks, but something would be missing in my life. Fast forward to today, 2014. I realize now so much how the world works. I have a much better understanding about money and business. My mind is clearer than ever. I am a capitalist. I am here to build and create in big ways. I have more street smarts now than book smarts. In my own company, I wanted to solve a major problem in our society. If people knew what problem I was trying to solve, they would be giving me a hug right now, instead of trying to hang me out to dry. I care a lot about society and the world. I do appreciate some of the support I received, but much more criticism. People think that 1 minute video is all me. That dont realize how much of a whole person I am. They would be surprised on who they are talking about. Some have criticized my College Truth 2 videos. They have useful information. So what if I act a little goofy in them. I believe Richard Branson said, You want to take your work seriously, but you dont have to take yourself seriously. How many people act serious, but yet dont do serious things? Now some realize that I am not some nut. To my critics out there, No one on this planet could ever bring me down with their words. I am too strong on the inside. Your words may hurt, but I will still be standing. What I started doing for my company is stealth recruiting. The problem with a normal interview is that people are on their best behavior not their actual behavior. You want to see people in their normal space and then evaluate accordingly. Eventually I am going to need team members for my company. So I started going around to retail stores and looking for people. I would interact with them, see who they are, see what they are about, ask questions, etc... In the future, to the ones I like, I would offer them a Round 1 interview. Many are college grads and I know they would like to do something better; even if it is just an internship for now. I am doing something in the product design field. One reason I wanted to work at Tesla is because the design process is the same. Tesla designed a sophisticated product and brought it to market. I intend to do the same for Royalus Design; though it would be a much simpler product that I would bring to market but sell in high volume. Either way the process is the same. I get to learn production methods and you have a true cap in front of you ready to help build and create. There is a huge revolution coming and I plan to be part of that. I missed the last one. There is also future vehicle development that I am interested in. I am studying flight dynamics, so the Model S or future Tesla cars or planes can be flight ready. That is where the future of transport is going and we want Tesla to be ready for it. I want to share a story with you. While in CA that week, I went to raise money for my company. I saw a person exiting a Model S. Ok great I will park by and say Hi. I asked this person, How do you like the car? The person told me that this car was a rental and his was in the shop. Apparently his Tesla suffered a major failure. That is odd I thought. I looked at the Model S rental car concerned, Why is this happening? This is unacceptable. It has been 2 years that the car has been in production, since 2012. Something like that got my attention and it bothered me. We talked some more. He then gave me his card and I left. He was running a startup. Also that week, I went to the SolarCity annual meeting. That was a short but useful meeting of good information. So much, it made me want to buy more shares; though I am short on cash at the moment. A gentleman was ready to fund me some cash, when I told him I was working on something big. That felt good when someone was willing to take a chance on you. What I bring to Tesla is very simple. I am a cap genius. I am a person who has very high aptitude and ability. I want to use that at your company. I am a right-brain genius by the way; a philosopher and entrepreneur. I am someone who brings a different perspective to the table. I am a thinker. I think most of the day. I also have great vision. I have much integrity, intelligence, and energy. I know you can relate to that. When you can see the future, you go for it. You dont waste time with people who cant. You know about that Musk. Being a leader is bringing out the best in everyone to achieve a common purpose. I believe I can do that well. I would like to be given the chance to do that at Tesla. Where I am at today is probably where you were 10 years ago. So you can understand where I am coming from. I can learn fast and become a great contributor. Society will get better when more societal capitalists come online. I am one of them. Me being offline does not help society at all. Help me come online Musk. Help me come online. I know there have been times you hired someone, who you thought was going to be great and they turned out to be not so great. I ask you do the reverse here and hire someone who looks not so great that can turn out to be great. This is 2nd look I am asking for Elon. If you havent done so already, please look over my resume and book. I gave a copy to Deepak Ahuja after the shareholder meeting. Deepak was considerate enough to speak to me for a moment. The position, I would come in now as, would be Consultant to CEO. I would be your extra eyes and ears while overseeing various projects and duties (like public speaking, presentations, talking to investors, media events, etc...). I could probably free up a third of your time. You would have a very rich and advanced mind looking after the company. I would report to you directly. I believe you stated you spend 2 days at Tesla. How would you like to spend 1 day at Tesla? Bring me on board and in time that could happen. I know you wouldnt just hand over your company to just anyone. I wouldnt either. But I am not just anyone. My last question to you Elon, is this? Warren Buffet has Charlie Munger as his partner. Larry Page has his Sergey Brin. Who does Elon Musk have? You could have Roy Philipose, as your partner. There is an equal in front of you today Elon Musk and you would want to embrace that and not dismiss it like others have. I want to thank you Elon, for your time and consideration. Please contact me back either way. Yours, Roy Cap Philipose Philosopher/Entrepreneur from Philadelphia",

    "input_text": "OP's Mom cheats on his step-dad and ruins his and his sisters' lives. Spoiler: gt;!This is a tragic update! lt; Trigger Warning: gt;!Suicide! lt; [ORIGINAL](<URL>) by [u/ThrowRAihatemymom](<URL>) **Mom(40F) cheated on Step-Dad(45M) and ruined my(16M) and my siblings' lives** I am a 16 years old male. I have 2 sisters (10F,8F). Our biological father was never in our lives. He left my mom when she was pregnant with me, came back 6 years later and said he wanted to make amends and that we could be a happy family. Somehow my mom immediately started saying that she loved him but he left after mom got pregnant again. Then 2 years later he came back, I cried and begged my mom to not let him into our lives because I hated him. Well, he said the same thing, my mom also said she loved him and then he left after she got pregnant again. My mom was a waitress so the 4 of us lived in a small one bedroom apartment. I was essentially another parent to my sisters because mom was always working. Sometimes, we wouldn't eat breakfast or dinner because we couldn't afford it. Other times, I did not eat anything so that my sisters could eat. My mom met another man (45M) a year after my youngest sister was born. He is a really good man. His wife and daughter had died in an accident a long time ago when he was in his 20s. He met my mom when he was ready to date again. He is a really good man and treated us like his own children and I consider him my father. He was very wealthy and owned multiple businesses. We eventually moved into his huge mansion like house. I also had a better school there. We 3 siblings got our own rooms and I got better clothes, played video games for the first time in my life and a bunch of other things. He taught me things, helped me catch up in school because I could not do well in the previous school. He spent a lot of time with the 3 of us. My sisters eventually started calling him \"dad\". I followed shortly after. I remember him crying, hugging us and telling he loved us when we called him dad for the first time. They eventually got married and dad asked me to be one of his groomsmen and of course, I said yes while my sister were my mom's bridesmaids. Mom stayed at home to take care of us. As far as I know, they were very happy together. They went on dates at least once in 2 weeks, kissed each other frequently and always told each other that they loved each other. He also knew about mom's past and realized she had issues and got her into counselling. I was really happy that my mom had finally found someone who treated her well. I was also very happy for myself and my siblings and really loved him. He also said that he would pay for college for the 3 of us. My dream is to become a doctor and I never thought it would be possible cause it was so expensive so and I was so freaking happy. Mom also told me she was very lucky to have found him and that she loves him and is very grateful of how he has made her and our lives better. Well, last year July dad discovered that my mom was having an affair with his best friend who was also the best man at their wedding. Apparently, the affair was going on for a long time, I do not know exactly how long. Mom cried and begged him to give her another chance. He didn't, understandably. He let us keep all the new things such as clothes for me and toys for my sisters. When I went to him crying and asking him why he was leaving us he just hugged me and told me about mom's affair. He said the affair is too painful and that he cannot be in this marriage anymore and then said that he loved me and my sisters. My sisters do not know about the affair, I do not think they will understand. He got a prenup so mom did not get anything that wasn't hers. Dad just had to pay the rent of a new apartment until the divorce was finalized. We stayed in a decent apartment but after the divorce was done we moved into a much smaller apartment. I tried to be in contact with him but it does not seem like he wants a relationship with me. He has never responded to my messages. I sent a final letter to him last year December thanking him for everything he did for me and my sisters and that I loved him and would remember him forever. So now we're back to a one bedroom apartment, skipping meals and barely being able to afford anything. I sleep on the floor now. My sisters share a bed while my mom uses another. Mom is a waitress again. I've also taken a part time at a grocery store to help with money. I just hate my mom so much right now. I only took the job to help my sisters. I have also stopped talking to mom. Recently she came crying to me and told me that she was sorry for ruining everything and she wanted me to talk to her. I broke down and just said \"I don't understand. Why did you cheat on him? He was taking such good care of you and the 3 of us. He was also gonna send us to college. For the first time in my life, I was happy. You have destroyed my life. Why do you always have to ruin everything? You already did that twice when you let \\[bio father\\] back in my life. I hate you. I never want to talk to you again\" She was crying a lot after I said that. I am gonna admit, what I said was pretty rude but at that time I was just so angry. I just hate her so much right now. I just wish she dies a very painful death. These thoughts are the only things in my head. It's making me go insane and I know it's not normal. I read online that therapy would be useful but we can't even afford food on most days so we don't have insurance. All I can think about is how she ruined everything. He didn't even ask for much. Mom was living such a luxurious life and was just at home taking care of her own biological children. I just miss him so much. Even my sisters keep asking when they are going back home or when they'll see dad again. They've also started crying and asking for dad a lot of times this past year. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am so frustrated and just angry at everything. I wish I could run from here but if I did who would take care of my siblings. That stupid mother can't do shit. I guess I'm here cause I need some help. I don't really know what to do. Some days, I'm just so tired and don't want to do anything. Other days I just wished I died and all of this ended. [UPDATE](<URL>) **My Mom(40F) Committed Suicide Because Of Me(16M)** Hello everybody. This is a throwaway account. About 2 weeks ago, I found my mom dead in our house. She had sent my siblings (10F,9F) to their friend's house and then hung herself. She really changed after she got divorced from my step dad after she cheated on him (I made a post about it recently). My mom and I didn't talk a lot after that. One of the last things I told her was that I hated her and asked her why she ruined my and my sisters' lives. I wish I didn't say that. Maybe she would have been alive if I supported her. I have had no contact with my step dad after the divorce. My sisters and I live with my mom's sister and her husband now. We never met them before this and even my mom never had contact with them but they are the only family that could be found and they agreed to let us live with them. My siblings and I don't like living here. Both of them are constantly shouting at each other and at us. We're just so uncomfortable here. I don't think they can afford food for all of us. I have a job at a grocery store so I mostly buy food for my siblings. My boss is also very nice and allows me to take home some extra things for free. I really miss my mom. My sisters are also always crying for her. She had her flaws but I still love her. She's my mom. The last thing I told her was that I hated her. I just wish that I told her that I love her and supported and helped her. Then she would've been alive today. What I told her tipped her over the edge. I can't do any of this anymore. I just don't know anything anymore.",

I started on Cypro and Estradiol 6 weeks ago, 12.5 mg and 1mg respectively, as a starter dose. This is to see if I experience any side effects and then we can raise my dose if I'm feeling okay. I was working really hard to be healthy at the start. I am on a fairly strict diet to make sure I'm eating enough and healthily (while still losing weight at a reasonable rate). I was doing cardio every day. I stopped smoking and drinking. The last couple weeks I've found myself really tired. It's hard for me to motivate myself to exercise and I'm spending more time in bed napping. I think that my hormone levels are really low because my dosage is really low. Did anyone else experience this on a starting dose? And if so, did their energy levels go back up once they were on a bigger dose? My appointment to raise my dose is in 2 days. I want to tell my nurse that I feel great because I want her to give me a higher dose. And that's mostly true, I just don't like being tired all the time, and... I'm really frustrated waiting for changes to take place. I know that I have to wait longer, I understand what the effects timelines look like, but actually waiting is agonizing. I was planning not to come out until I had been on hormones for a while, but I got forced out in July while still on the wait list at my clinic. Coming out ended up going better than I expected, but it also means that I don't have the HRT lead time that I wanted. I know that I'm a woman with all my heart but I can't help but feel some of the creeping 'imposter syndrome' and its a little draining. Like what if I never look like I want to, what if people can always tell, what if the difficulties associated with being visibly trans outweigh the benefits of transitioning. I just want to know the hormones are working. I'm sorry, that turned into a bit of a rant. ** My question is this: For those who experienced a lower energy level on low doses of HRT, did your energy levels improve upon raising your doses?** Edit: Grammar.",

I've been practicing about an hour to 1.5 hours a day. In addition, over the past month and change I have been mussing around with a strat that a friend is letting me long-term-borrow along with an application called rocksmith - usually another hour to another hour and a half a day. However, I seem to be hitting a pretty heavy wall. My teacher had been assigning 3-4 pieces a week, though that has slowed down. Reading reviews, apparently one of the big criticisms of the Parkening books is that they have a HUGE ramp up in difficulty. I am up to about exercise 60 (Beethoven's 5th) and I'm finding that I just can't keep up. Working on that one piece all week, playing extremely slow (15 bpm-30bpm), and I'm only about half way through. My fingers just can't seem to find the right spots on the fretboard and it doesn't seem to be sticking mentally. It just feels like my progress has seriously slowed down at this point and I'm feeling a little discouraged. Is this normal - like if I just keep pushing it will pass?

    "input_text": "I have sleep paralysis almost every night. Sometimes it includes a demon of sorts and sometimes it's just the paralysis. There's been times where it's a guy that's about as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger back in the eighties. He usually hides in the corner of the room dry humping a bed that only exists with him. He wears a hat like a drill sergeant. Other times it's an evil presence without any shadow or physical appearance. The evil presence is always accompanied by a feeling of something weighing me down like pressure on my chest. There's been times where it's a shadow that whispers my name. I end up asking my wife if it was her though really I know what it was. When this happens I watch comedy on Netflix to clear my mind and get back to sleep. I discovered new (to me) comedians like John Pinette with this method. I'm not sure if it's related to sleep paralysis, but I have dreams accompanied by sleep paralysis like symptoms at the end of a dream. Such dreams involve me living life as usual and suddenly I'm transported to a different place. This place is usually a desert and it's usually dark. I can only see about a five foot radius around myself and everything else is pitch black but not like night black but sharpie marker black. I just start floating around and of course I find it fun... at first. Then I float to this area that has like prison bars behind me. I can't control the floating anymore and it's creepy. I then hear a little kid's voice whispering and screaming all at once. The kid is whisper screaming \"help me, please!\" \" Please help!\" I turn around and behind the bars is a little kid, terrified. The kid's eyes are just eye sockets and blood drips down from the sockets. I scream a very high pitched scream that can be heard in the waking world. It's a scream I can not mimic while awake. Before my wife wakes me up, I'm paralysed the same as when I have a more standard sleep paralysis episode.",

    "input_text": "Little Cows About ten years ago, I dated a masseuse named Valerie. Well, masseuse in training. She was passionate and enthusiastic and she practiced as frequently as she could. That meant I got a ton of free massages. Obviously, since we were a couple, those massages would escalate and turn into that usual thing couples do, but it was only after she felt shed gotten in a good practice session. After one of our, ahem, sessions, Val looked a little confused but also relieved. I asked her what was up. She told me the sores she had on the inside of her mouth didnt hurt anymore. Wed talked about those things before. She said they werent contagious, thankfully, but shed had to endure them for most of her life and they were intensely painful; sometimes even debilitatingly so. Doctors prescribed an ointment for her to put on them when the outbreaks occurred, but they barely took the edge off. Plus, she was deeply attached to the ideas of natural healing and homeopathy and all that, so she very, very rarely used the medication. But that night, for the first time in a while, I could tell she wasnt powering through her pain. She genuinely felt good and had no idea why. Her pain returned a few hours later. As always, she did her best to ignore it. Fast forward a couple days - another massage, another occasion for sexy times. Midway through, she stopped kissing me and exclaimed, thats it! I didnt know what she was talking about. She rolled off me and stuck her finger in my mouth. Not really sure what the hell was going on, I just sat up on the bed and let her do whatever she was doing. She pulled her wet finger from my mouth and stuck it in her own. I saw her rubbing the inside of her cheek. Her face brightened and she informed me, with complete certainty, that my saliva was taking away her pain. I laughed and said something encouraging despite thinking she was nuts. Then she hopped back on me and I completely forgot everything shed said. The next day, I was lying face down on her massage table. She was doing her usual, outstanding work while I stared down at the floor through that little padded hole where ones face goes. Without any warning, there was a blinding pain in my head. I passed out. I have no idea how long I was unconscious. When I came to, I tried to get up, but I was completely immobilized. I couldnt turn my head or lift my arms. It felt like I was taped to the table. Not only that, but there was something metal in my mouth. I couldnt close my jaw or even dislodge the thing with my tongue. I yelled around it. Valerie, whod apparently been standing next to me, simply said, shhhhhh. I saw her hand and arm appear in front of my down-turned face. She held a small, glass baking dish, which she placed on the floor under my mouth. Im sorry if the speculum is uncomfortable, she said. At the mention of the word, I gagged. A thin column of saliva drooled from my gaping maw and landed inside the glass container. She reached under and gathered a dollop of the fluid onto her fingertip. Her hand disappeared from my field of view, but I knew where it was going. I heard her moan with relief. Im not sure how long Ill keep you here, she informed me. But dont be loud. In response, I yelled. A hideously sharp pain erupted from my lower back, right around my left kidney. Thats a 3 inch long pin, Valerie said. Please dont scream anymore. I hate hurting people. As the hours went by, the bottom of the pan grew slick with a cloudy puddle of my saliva. I heard Valerie walking around the house, doing laundry, washing dishes; basic, everyday activity. The clatter of pots and pans told me it was almost dinner time. I was ravenous; I estimated itd been almost 24 hours since Id had any food. Glorious aromas wafted from the kitchen as she cooked. My salivary glands went into overdrive and I drizzled their secretions into the waiting container. I heard Val walk in and she placed a plate piled high with spaghetti carbonara and what appeared to be a pork chop directly next to the collection pan. My mouth oozed. You cant have this, she whispered in my ear. But feel free to enjoy the smell. She walked away and turned on the TV. The room filled with sitcom banalities as my body leaked its desire for the meal into the waiting dish. I wanted to cry. At some point, I fell asleep. When I woke up in the morning, the plate of food was gone. The house was quiet. I assumed Val had gone to class. I gargled out a weak yell, but theres no way anyone wouldve heard it. I was so incredibly thirsty. The smell from the collected saliva was absolutely horrendous. I could see particulate matter dotting the glass bottom; probably old food that had detached from between my teeth. My mouth felt terribly dry. Saliva still leaked from the glands, but it was thick, almost like corn syrup. The color was milky gray. When it hit the stuff that was already in the pan, it separated like salad dressing. Oily liquid swirled to the top. I couldnt believe how much Id produced over the last couple days. The sound of the front door opening heralded the return of Valerie. She walked over, putting her sneakers in my narrow view. I felt her scratch the top of my head. You doing okay?, she asked, sounding genuinely concerned. I muttered something obscene from around the speculum. She bent down and picked up the pan. Saliva sloshed thickly against the sides. Im going to let you go today, Val informed me. I choked out a sigh of relief. I saw a knife for a second and was certain she was about to cut my throat. Instead, she sliced through the duct tape that was holding my head to the table. I craned my neck upward and tried to shake out the awful muscle cramps. In front of me, I watched Val carefully pour some of the accumulated spit into a glass. She brought it to her lips and took a tiny sip. I almost threw up. She didnt swallow right away. I could see her swishing it around her mouth and aerating it as if she were a disgusting sommelier sampling a fine Brunello. She smiled at me as she swallowed. Valerie reached into her purse and pulled out a small handgun. Of course she had a fucking gun. I didnt move. She calmly told me she was about to cut me loose but if I ran before she could talk to me, Id get shot. She cut the tape away. I was suddenly self-conscious as the smell of my old spit was replaced by the ammonia odor of when Id pissed myself those two times. Dont worry about it, she whispered. After everything was cut away, she apologized in advance before pulling the tape off my head to unsecure the speculum still violating my mouth. Chunks of hair came with the tape and I winced. I let the metal instrument drop to the ground. My jaw felt like itd been pummelled by a prize fighter. I stood up and Val pointed the gun at my chest. I stretched, slowly, then sat back down. She took another small sip before she spoke. When you leave, I know youre going to call the police. And I know Ill get arrested. But I just want you to know how much I appreciate you for helping me. I didnt say anything. She was nuts. She gulped down the rest of the cold saliva and put the glass on the coffee table. The pan was still 75% full. You can go, she told me. I grabbed my car keys from the table and left. As soon as I closed the door to her apartment, I sprinted as quickly as my cramped legs would allow, got into the car, and drove away. As I went home, I called 911 and did my best to explain what happened. They said theyd stop by her place and see what was going on, then theyd visit me at home. Sure enough, a few hours later, the police visited my apartment. They told me Valerie was dead. Self-inflicted gunshot wound. Shed left a note, but all it said was, youll understand soon enough. A year later, I started getting sores in my mouth. The pain was indescribable. Theyd last for a couple days before bursting. Theyd eventually heal, but two weeks later theyd just reappear. I was missing work because I couldnt even breathe through my mouth without searing agony. The doctors gave me some awful-tasting ointment to put on them, but it might as well have been water. Nothing helped. I didnt want to, but I started sleeping around. Men, women, it didnt matter. Partner after partner crossed my bed. Finally, I found one. Then another. Then another. Seven years later, theyre up to a gallon of production per day. The flavor took some getting used to, but hey, the taste of medicine doesnt matter much when it actually works. The trick, I learned, was to keep my producers hydrated and fed just enough so the quality doesnt drop off. Early on, my little cows (thats what I call them) used to be pretty boisterous in the mornings when I went to collect their milk, but theyve calmed down over the years. I just hope they know how much I appreciate them. Deep down, I bet they do. [Unsettling Stories](<URL>), [FB](<URL>)",

    "input_text": "Too Much At This Time This post will probably be a bit of a mess. Over the past couple of months I've started to realize that I'm relying too much on my pain medication to get me through days that I'm not having problems with my condition that I'm prescribed it for. I would like to stop using it altogether and try other pain management things but right now I'm too afraid that trying to do that will topple this proverbial card house that I've built. Nothing feels stable. I'm only 23 but it still worries me that I have no real direction in my life. My job is not a bad one but there is no option for moving up in the company from my position. I have just barely enough money to scrape by each month if I'm actually being responsible and most months I don't even make my student loan payment. I filed bankruptcy a few months ago and now I worry if anything happens to my car I won't be able to get another one. I have severe anxiety that I take medication for that tends to make me sleepy a lot so my energy level is almost a non-existent sliver on a graph. I think this makes me feel like a don't have the will to change things a lot of the time because I'm just too tired. I know my pills aren't really helping anything. They are supposed to be there for when my endometriosis symptoms flare up and I absolutely have to have something. But I'm taking them four or more times a week and have to really try hard not to take them more just because I'm having problems dealing with things in other areas of my life. I'm sure counseling might help but I'm too afraid that I really can't afford $50 just to go talk to someone for an hour. I was thinking about going to an NA meeting but I get anxious around groups of people larger than 3-ish and I feel like they might realize I'm not really ready to quit yet and call me out on it. I really wish I had a better support system. I do have my best friend, we are close and have been for about 13 years but she also struggles with things that make me worry about putting any more on her shoulders. I also have my boyfriend but we have only been dating for a little over 5 months and I worry about telling him how unstable I really feel. I'm not close with my family at all. I'm just not sure where to start making changes in my life and I'm afraid of trying to give up the one thing that helps me get through bad days with everything else I'm supposed to be dealing with. :(\nNeedless to say, I'm having a bit of a rough day.",

I'm a non-judgmental person that loves when people tell me about their day or something that happened to them that particular day. I'm a very down to earth person that enjoys life. A best friend would make it even more enjoyable. I love music, Netflix, animals, the beach, pretty much anything to occupy me. I'm really mature and I know how to handle myself as well. With that being said, if you're interested in having a loyal, honest, \"count on me\" best friend, please message me or comment. We'll see where it goes. Oh, and it doesn't matter male or female either. :)",

    "input_text": "My Beautiful Roses As a child I lived in Turkey. Since growing up and moving to the United States I have realized that many people know nothing of the country. It was not the best of places, nor the worst of places, but that isn't important. The one spectacular part about that country was that it is pretty much the only place in the world where you can find black roses. I adored the flower, I found them so deeply beautiful. It wasn't long before I decided to grow them around my own home. I lived alone with my father, and the first time that the flowers bloomed outside our home he was unhappy. He thought they were hideous. I ignored his displeasure, these flowers were the one thing in the world that brought me joy. My father was a cruel man, he was not good at raising a daughter on his own. I did the housework exclusively, and I made all the meals. He told me that it was my place. He let me tend to my flowers as long as I was obedient. I did my best to do everything correctly, but more often than not I faced severe punishment over miniscule errors. There were many times when I was punished for nothing at all. My father bore a hatred for the world that I never knew the source of, and as I grew older I realized that he also bore a hatred for women. He took those hatreds out on me, I became both servant and wife. I was entirely miserable, but so very afraid. My only solace was tending to my roses. They were the last beautiful thing in my life at that point. One day when I neared the age of 15 I met a strange woman on my trip to get food for our dinner. She looked like a gypsy, and she fell in step with me as I walked. Child, I know you have been hurt, She looked me over from head to toe, Hurt quite deeply. I nodded. Your roses can help you, and this, She held out a bundle of strange looking flowers, Witch hazel. I took the bundle hesitantly, What for? A few of these, and one rose under the bed, each night. Save yourself, She abruptly turned and walked away. I didn't understand, but decided to try it just to see what would happen. That night after father was done with me and had fallen asleep, I snuck into his room and placed the plants under his bed. I did so every day for a week. Each morning he complained of being sicker, and he seemed to grow too weak to bother punishing me. On the seventh day he didn't arise from his bed. I found him in a puddle of his own blood, it had seemingly spewed from every orifice. My pain was over. I've made sure to always grow black roses since then. They truly are the most amazing flower.",

    "input_text": "you are VERY welcome. i can relate to feeling guilty over just about anything; i dont know why but guilt has always been a huge part of my anxiety issues. its like, i KNOW im trying to do the right thing and be a good person but somehow it often FEELS like im just a douche, if that makes sense? one of the hardest things sometimes is taking care of yourself and being kind to yourself. i think because we worry we are just being selfish or narcissistic ourselves, but not wanting to take on someone elses issues because you know how much it will hurt you actually shows empathy, in my opinion, which is the opposite of narcissism. especially if they only want you to hurt anyway. its like; if you can pull a drowning person out of the water, you can try to help them and give them mouth to mouth and bring them back to you. but if you cant pull them out, if they are fighting you and dont want your help, you have to recognize that before they drag you under with them. sorry that got a bit dramatic at the end there but i think its still relevant :/ i think knowing you are doing the right thing and dealing with your own guilt issues is a far more manageable task than dealing with other people abusing and shaming you because of THEIR issues. its not worth it, you do not deserve it, you are better than that and although it may not feel like it, there is NO SHAME in saving your own life (literally or metaphorically) if and when it comes to that. edit: spellings",

    "input_text": "I don't live at home, but I am not fully independent yet. By that, I mean I have no bills to pay, so nothing really to worry about. I moved away from my family in February, and the time I'm spending away will come to an end some time in May 2016. I do not want to move back with my parents at all. My plan was to move to a city about 9 hours away with my dog, and to go to school there (in Canada). I am lucky enough to have parents who are saving up money for my education (unless they're lying to me about that ..), so I will be using this money for school, then try to get a job. The city I'll be moving to is really cheap, and is right by the border, which separates it from a major American city, so there is opportunity from two lands there. I think I've matured enough in the last few years to understand that this isn't going to be easy. And I've accepted potential defeat, though I'm still a stubborn kid at heart, and I refuse to fully accept the outcome of potential failure (like moving back with my family). Doesn't mean I wouldn't. Stories like this scare the shit out of me. I like to believe that I'm ready to live alone, and in a sense, I am! I am partially doing it right now. But money wise, I am terrified. I don't want to have debts, I don't want to be worried about where I spend my money. I know how to budget and I can live cheaply (though sometimes I go overboard), but who says I'll be getting a job? Who says I'll be able to live cheaply at all? For instance, I don't need much space so a studio apartment is perfect for me. I found one for less than 400 dollars a month, which is amazing. Everything included. However, a roof over my head is not the only thing I'll be needing to pay for. Of course, bringing a pet into the mix basically means paying hundreds of dollars for it per year. Will I be able to afford it? Also, food. Food is not so cheap in Canada compared to the US. And, transportation. The city I selected doesn't have a good transportation system, meaning I'll have to figure something out. I'm not a fan, plus it's expensive. Summers are hot in that city, and Canadian winters are not really forgiving to bicycles. And ... who says I'll be getting the hours I need from a job? Who says I'll ever get a job at all ...\nI'm sorry I'm rambling. I am just terrified of failing.",
