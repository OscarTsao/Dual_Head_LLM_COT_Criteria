    "input_text": "I'm very stressed and I know why, but what can I do about it? Please help me I'm a 21 year old man. Right now I have summer break, but I still feel as if I'm always working 24/7. I never enjoy anything in life (I'm also depressed and I have many mental issues) and I'm always tired and unmotivated about everything. And every single day feels as a heavy work day, even if I am at home having \"free\" time. There are 2 reasons of my high stress. Reason 1 is being an unhappy single and reason 2 is trying so hard to find someone, which costs alot of effort and time. Before you read this, I am NOT here for dating advice, so please dont, unless you have a magic trick that will 100% sure work for ME. Since 4 years ago when I was 17, I started developing interest in girls. Now, 21, I still never had a relationship, but even worse, I never had a date or even a female friend even though I have tried different strategies which I failed. I never hugged a girl either. I have exactly 0 experience with girls. Why am I so stressed? It is because those 4 years, first of all: being single makes me unhappy. And second: I have been trying very hard to find a girl, to get the first date in my life or to even make a female friend. Every single day I waste my time on ~~dating~~ i mean ENDLESS SWIPING apps. ( read: neverending swiping but never getting a match), asking on reddit how to get a girlfriend, asking google how to get a girlfriend, thinking about being single forever, you know what I mean. I waste alot of my time and energy in doing research about how to find a girlfriend but trust me, I have really tried going outside and trying out dating apps, I really tried stuff too. Nothing works. So how can I feel less stressed? Find the love of my life and be happy, but this won't happen any time soon, it seems impossible. So what can I do to get my mind off the impossible? I really have hobbies and interests, I have a life so that's not the problem here. The only missing part in my happiness is having a girlfriend. I feel very frustrated and tired and stressed and im starting to hate life. Seeing guys getting girlfriends as if it's the easiest thing in the world just makes me angry. These days even 10 year old kids have relationships. I guess my purpose on earth is just to be a loser. I am so obsessed with dating and trying everything that I have no more focus on anything else in my life. I dont care about family anymore, I dont care about my friends anymore, I dont care about my hobbies anymore, I dont care about study anymore, I dont care about anything except I just want a girlfriend. How can I be happy without having a partner? Really, I have study, I have a great family, I have friends, I have a hobby, my life is fine. Except for being girlfriend-deprived which really bothers me alot. It seems impossible to focus on anything else than how to get a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to feel more happy and relaxed and stop hating life? Whenever I play videogames or do whatever to relax and try to enjoy, it doesnt really make me happy because my frustration of being single and fear or being single forever, stays in the background of my thoughts no matter what i'm doing or focusing on. And whenever I try to relax or study or do anything, I feel guilty towards my dating life, thinking if i don't take action I will never find a partner What should I do to feel happy and not frustrated and stressed??? Am I asking for the impossible here? Because honestly I thikn there is no way I can be happy without a partner. I just have this desire, and it's really strong and it's growing stronger. I can't just remove my desire, can I? Edit: please don't tell me to get therapy or medication. I already tried that and, just no. + therapy would also take even more of my time and energy, which I don't have this year.",

Most of the time, I literally went to school and went home to get on the internet, and stayed in my room. Originally, I was very socially awkward due mostly because of my terrible home life, but was still very sociable. Just annoying, though. 7th grade was a terrible year, it was my first year at the junior high, and I was quickly learning how cruel other kids could be. I mean I was annoying, I deserved some of the hate I got, but there were some things that happened that were practically unwarranted. It was around that time that I moved to my grandparent's house to get away from my homelife abuse, and it just came to me that I was tired of other people. So very, very tired. My self esteem was in the pits. I was tired of being the subject of ridicule, of being a psychological punching bag of my peers and family. And I knew it had to do with the fact that I was hopeless at social interaction. I don't know what happened, but it was like some part of my brain just... slowed to a stop when I realized just how shitty everything was. Some part of me broke, I think. I stopped interacting with my peers mostly. I spent a lot of time studying. I pretty much only spoke when I had something witty to say. Soon... people started liking me. My only friend year later told me that someone from one of my classes told her, \"test_subject3112 used to be really weird, but she's cool now\". That's right, I was cool because I wasn't an annoying shit anymore and just shut up. Because of my bad self esteem, this pretty much only reinforced my behavior. While I did learn a great amount of patience from my actions, it is terribly regrettable. I developed severe social anxiety because I have worried so much about making myself presentable to others. I kept silent, I figured shutting up and being obedient and staying out of others way was the best and easiest way to coast through school. Now it is difficult to be employed, to leave my house, to make friends. I am anxious much of the time. I quit my last job due to a panic attack. Apathy has encroached on every aspect of my life. My therapist actually told me my depression is worse than my anxiety. At the time this all started, I could hardly cope with the stress. I'm thinking it is probably a combination of school and home pressure that caused me to break and retreat within myself. I greatly fear rejection. People tell me not to care about what others think, but I have realized from so many years of being alone that people are a part of our lives whether we want them there or not.",

I've been a little \"chubby\" for most of my life, but was a pretty good/healthy weight until Junior year of high school. I just got lazy. I didn't want to walk the four blocks home from school. Throughout college, I was just too lazy to go to class. I started putting weight on, went from 5'5 135 lbs when I was around 16, to 160-ish when I was around 20. I've recently been diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue, in addition to a spinal condition, which explains some of that, and which has also put my weight over 190 at one point. I am 5'7 now, so a tad taller, but 190 is way over what I want to be. I have struggled with binge eating for a decade, but I think I'm finally recovering from that because I've gone from binging 2500+ calories every other day, to just finding a snack when I feel like I want to binge. While I have been eating healthier over the past few months, I slip up constantly. I bought a treadmill but can hardly ever convince myself to get on it. \" Tomorrow\" is my mantra. I've been convincing myself to put my fitness aside to deal with my back, but that's not really it, either. I don't know what it is. I don't stick to anything for more than a couple of weeks. I give in at the slightest sign of an unhealthy meal, and instead of getting back on track, I just give up. So, loseit, what has kept you on track? What tricks, systems, or motivators do you have that have kept you from slipping again and again? I'm hardly making progress.

Here's why I think so: 1. Taking time away helps me solve problems in unusual ways. When I'm working, my brain tends to focus narrowly on a problem. So, I'll tend to explore something deeply but ignore anything that's not obvious. (\" Damnit, this level is taking too long to load. I must optimize the loading functions to shave off 1.1 seconds.\") The time I spend walking, showering, or taking a crap (not all at once, usually) is time my brain just wanders, and can make really neat connections. (\" Oh, holy crap. Instead of spending five hours getting a 0.5% decrease in loading time, what if I just do something to entertain the player during load?\") It allows me to be more creative in my design for the same reason. When I'm not in the \"MUST BE PRODUCTIVE AT ALL COSTS\" mode, I'll start to think about how to give our games more character. For example, in one of our games, I decided to stick elevator music into the level select screen; in another, I drafted a(n admittedly amateurish) rap song for the title. These were tiny things, but people loved them, and the press talked about both. Related to #1, limiting my hours forces me to solve problems in ways other than \"Gee, I'll just toss more of my time at it.\" For example, I'll spend 10 hours talking to people about helping me on level design rather than committing myself to spending 8 hours a week for 8 weeks designing all the levels, myself. And related to /that/, the more time I spend socializing, the more people I randomly meet - and some of those help me make better games. For instance, some years ago, I decided to suck up my pride and try to learn salsa dancing. Through that, I ended up meeting the dude who's now my biz dev guy (I would never have expected that). I also met my wife though that, and aside from that being great in its own right, she works in a creative industry, and consults for us. ( She gives us good rates.) Similarly, taking time to get to know other game devs socially has resulted in project collaborations. Suddenly, there's this network of people who want to work together on all these amazing projects. So, I'll agree with those folks posting here: if you're spending 90h/week working, you are probably missing out on a lot of awesome stuff!",

My mom, dad, little brother, big sister, and her two kids were there. The cake was very beautiful. Icing roses, and amazing artwork by my sister made with some gooey candy stuff that I can't quite remember the name of. A little card, kind of like the one you would get from a business place with contact info on it, seated itself atop the cake with the writing \"Happy Birthday!\" It was a good day. One of my nephews was whacking around a foam sword, unintentionally breaking three of the most expensive things in my house. I joked with my sister that we should keep a tally on how many things would be in pieces before the day would end. She laughed and turned to face me. Because of this, she didn't see my nephew coming full force with his foam sword. Splat, the cake was mushed to a pulp. My sister scolded her son for a second. She then took away the foam swords and apologized. I told her it was nothing. She gave me a look and fixed her eyes on the cake. \" It's still good\" I said. I then proceeded to convince her along with the rest of the family that this was the case. After all, it would be a bitch to fix up another one. And, I honestly didn't think I deserved that much treatment. That was the reason I convinced them it was fine; the cake was still good. When all was good and done, I said my good bye's to my family before they went home. I was in good spirits, I didn't even notice that little tickle in my throat. It wasn't until I was laying silent in bed, moon looming over me. Swallowing, I felt this strange tingle of pain. I got some water, and then the pain seemed to settle. over the course of two days, it got worse. It wasn't pain this time, it was a tickle. After the third day, I just couldn't concentrate on anything. Because of this, I decided to see a Doctor. I thought of a bunch of thing's this tickle could possibly be. A sexual disease, flu, my smoking catching up with me, and loads more. If your curios about the first one, I just started dating this wonderful girl. You never know. Let's move on. The Doctor thought nothing of it when i told him how it felt. He \"diagnosed\" that I had a sore throat, or an allergy. I took what he had said as the truth. No reason to worry, right? It wasn't really hurting at this point, so I couldn't say other wise. Well, unfortunately, it turned back into a sore throat a day later. I decided to call in sick, my throat bothered me enough to do so. With enough sleep and a healthy dose of water, I would get over this I thought. I had no idea how bad things would escalate. That same god damn tickle turned into an itch. Sooner or later I started to scratch the outside of my neck. Then, inside my throat as well. It wasn't like before where I would swallow constantly to stop the pain. This time I used my nail's to sooth the pain in my throat. My neck for some weird reason became more of a problem as time went on as well. I started scratching a lot there too. Without even thinking, I started to scratch. When the pain would engulf my throat and neck, I would scratch. Later on, If I wasn't scratching, I could feel the pain. Over a short period of time this itch got out of hand. The pain kept getting severe, and more so as time went on. I kept scratching. From then on, the blind's remained closed since the light from outside started to hurt my eyes. With the blinds closed, it hurt less to see. Funny enough though, with the blinds closed I could barely see. I was okay with it though. I always preferred the dark anyway. After awhile, I started getting call's from work after four days of being absent; I stopped answering them. After three week's of this itch, I was kinda loopy. I knew this wasn't normal, something was going on. The problem with knowing something's wrong is when you don't quite know what that problem is. A day literally felt like a week. In the back of my mind, I even started to think that a ghost or a demon was behind this. I never thought that was the issue, though it was hard trying to keep it out of mind. Soon, it got hard to talk. At one point, I almost felt as if i couldn't say a word without pain rushing behind my sentences. My throat was completely void of any moisture. Truthfully, I didn't think it was as bad as it was, despite knowing this was not your normal sore throat. In my head, my logical calm self was in charge. It said \"Mike, you should really see a doctor soon and get back to your boss about this.\" I was worried, but not as much as I should have been. After some debate in my head, I decided to call the doctor to schedule another appointment. My head started to feel clouded, and I couldn't think straight without mustering enough mentality to do so. My hand reached for my cell, it was charging in front of the alarm clock. God, when was the last time I used it? I stopped as my hand touched the phone. Something looked off. I didn't notice it at first, and I cannot comprehend how I didn't notice sooner. How often I was scratching, all I did was sleep, thought's seeming cloudy, thinking it was just the same pain I had in my throat from the very start. I had blood on my fingers. I tried to yell out \"Jesus Christ!\", but it was so painful I couldn't bear one letter. If the light from the alarm clock didn't alert me when I went to grab my phone, I don't know how much longer that stained hand would have gone unnoticed. Despite the major headache that ensued from getting up too quickly, I opened the blinds. The Light felt like a literal stab in the eyes. I didn't let that stop me from turning around to check my bed. I couldn't tell that there was a nice big blotch of blood on my bed, my vision was way to impaired too. I just stood there until I could see exactly what I suspected to see. The only thing that scared me is it was a little bigger than I first thought. I looked down afterwards to see a puddle forming in front of me. I shoved my fingers down my throat to where I had been scratching. There was an indent. I felt my neck. There was a slight, shallow indent. And from what I could see, a whole lot of blood. Things started to blur. I was absolutely terrified. I started to black out, so I tried to reach for my phone to call 911. I tripped, and landed with my face leaning against the bed. I tried my best to get up, yet due to my blood loss I kept fumbling over and over again. I really thought I was going to die right there. Although, my will power, or instinct, whatever you call it, came over me and I forced myself up. My vision was literally coming in and out as I stumbled over my bed. It felt kinda like slow motion. That's the best way I could describe it. Sounds a little dramatic, but I wasn't scared anymore; I was trying to survive. I finally got to my phone and then attempted to dial 911. I don't remember if I got it wrong once or twice, just that I wanted to cry when I messed up. Finally, the ring. * ring* *ring* *ri-* \"Hello, this is 911, what's your emergency?\" I felt so woozy as I tried to speak. When I finally did mange to focus enough to speak, I couldn't. My throat, my fucking throat hurt so immensely that I couldn't even say a word. I was dying, I could feel it. Once again, I was scared. I then screamed in my mind \"Your gonna die, so just yell. Yell as hard as you can.\" I slammed the phone on the counter, Then I yelled at the top of my lungs. It was the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. After that last desperate call for help, nothing, black. I woke up in a hospital bed, light hurting my eyes. My family wasn't there yet. I looked around until I saw a doctor walking towards me, he wanted to make sure I was looking fine and stable. He then explained everything that happened to me. how lucky I was to be alive, my family should be here soon, the condition I was is, and the surgical process they went through. You want to hear the funny part of this story? During surgery, they removed a certain something from my throat. It was a small, cardboard like paper. You know the one's they give to you at business places with their contact info and all that? It was like that. There was also something written on it. \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\"",

I spoke to my psychiatrist about this and she suggested I take it sooner to the time I go to bed to get adjusted to it. That helped a lot. I started taking it when I knew I wasnt going to be moving around and could just lay in bed and fall asleep. As far as remove my dreaming is has never done that. What it has done for me is make my nights tolerable to get through. I dont wake up in panic, sweating, trying to catch my breathe multiple times throughout the night. I can get a solid 5-6 hours of uninterrupted sleep now which I havent had for years. Ask your doctor first and you may have to get some tests before hand but adding in more salt to your diet can help with the affects of low blood pressure, but again Im not a doctor so ask your doctor.

We live in a society where the next best thing is promoted. We live in a time where being depressed is frowned upon. My doctor once explained depression like wearing sunglasses. A lot of is see the world differently and it is ok. We all have different circumstances to deal with. I am currently rereading The Art of Living by Epictitus. It is a stoic philosophy about accepting who we are and focusing on the things in our own control. I am challenged with the fact that i have memory/data recollection issues. It makes me sad because i am surrounded by people having interesting conversations all the time, and growing from them, while i feel like i stuck. I do have a very high EQ which is emotional intelligence. I am extremely sensitive to the point where other peoples vibration effect me and i dont know what is mine or somebody elses. I know i am very loved by the people around me and am always told i give the best hugs. I compliment people as much as i can because i want to believe that my purpose in life is to feel these things. To understand life from a darker more complex view but still be the most loving, kind, and caring person possible. Yet, here i find myself. Distrought. Wishing i had it different. But i cant allow myself to plummet. I have support but sometimes it is not enough, because nobody knows exactly what kind of shit i deal with. It is nice knowing that others are out there with similar views and distresses, but the personal challenges will always be there. All i can say to you. Is that you are normal. We are all normal. Life in the world is all go go go! But we need to sit back, power down a little, and accept who we are for what we are. It may not get better, because life around us isnt going to stop. But i hope we can find that spark inside of us that allows us to be content with ourselves. Keep your chin up. Know that you are loved.",

I have some updates to that story and I would like to hear your opinions on what I should do. I waited a few weeks after my first post and I sent her a card that generally said I'm sorry for what I did, I will give you space if you want space, but I am here for you if you want me to be here. It was a very kind card (at least I think so): I didn't make any implications that she should reply or anything like that, it was very neutral and she could have done whatever she wanted with it. She then posts on her Tumblr a few things. First, she posts this:\n\"Im tired of this. I have already made it very clear how I feel. The rest I dont think I have any obligation to explain. I am done caring.\" She then deletes it maybe an hour later (I was checking it pretty obsessively) and posts this:\n\"There is really nothing I have to say to you, because every time I do try to think of something to say, all that comes to me are words of anger. Thats not something Id like to do, unless maybe it is really necessary for you to understand. So now the only thing I have to say is that I think the best thing to do now is just to let go and move on. I have made my peace and I will let go of whatever anger there is remaining. I have no regrets, no blame, no guilt, and no will to even try to explain anymore. I would like to move on without even the tiniest things holding me back. Though I guess I do have one more thing. Saturday did not hurt me as much as you might think it did. So let go of whatever guilt you say you have. There is no reason to hold onto it anymore. I get pretty angry and start to vent things on my Tumblr, which I thought she didn't know about. I said some very mean, untrue things. I was just so angry and I was writing down whatever came to my mind. Turns out she DID know about my Tumblr and read everything. She sends me a very angry email saying things like \"obviously I was too nice, and you're taking advantage of that, you don't say these things to people to make you feel better about yourself.\" She legitimately thought that I wrote it in the intent that I wanted her to read it. Her friends messages me too, doing general \"you're spewing nonsense, you obviously don't know my friend, grow up and leave her alone you don't deserve her\". I send her friend a message explaining that I didn't know she knew about my Tumblr and that I never intended for her to read what I wrote, and that I would leave them alone. She sends a message back thanking me and saying that what I've said means a lot (not sarcastically, I think she really meant it). Sorry for another wall of text. I don't really like leaving anything out. My question now is, do you think that I should wait this out and see what happens, or do you think the situation is wrecked and I should move on? She obviously did not want to repair this even before she read what I wrote, but I know that it hasn't even been that much time since our initial argument. I know everyone said to wait a few months, but I knew I would feel like shit until I did something proactive. Thanks so much for all your help.",

    "input_text": "My experiences of meditation so far in detail - No TL;DR, I hope it's an enjoyable read and please share your experiences in the comments. My mind is always busy whenever I start meditation, thoughts are popping in and out like a main road. All what I do is catch myself whenever I start drifting off with them, I don't punish myself for it or even make another thought about it, I just return to my attempted stillness. It still takes me a while, maybe five to ten minutes, for that main road of thoughts to slow it's traffic. When it has quietened down however I notice and know I am on the right path; this path is often accompanied by abstract imagery and completely unrelated to one another thoughts. During my best meditations I keep this up and reach what I consider actual 'meditation'. I perceive this to be actual 'meditation' because this is the furthest I've came in the process. During this stage surreal and extraordinary things happen. During my entire meditation session I am always aware of a rising numbness in my body, I'm used to this from my attempts at astral projection and lucid dreaming. However it can (not always) reach a level in meditation where I feel lighter than air, as if someone has tied perfectly balanced balloons to different points of my body and I'm now no longer effected by gravity. The main 'effect' this 'meditation' has on me though is in my mind. There are multiple states I can enter into but they are all similar in feeling and aftereffect. The main one is where I have zero thoughts and almost feels like my consciousness has been enveloped by a bubble of quiet. The only way I can describe the feeling of it is [this shot](<URL>) in Spirited Away. That specific shot where she is in a bubble of water. It is like I am in a womb where there is no such thing as thoughts, time or worries. Another state of mind I have entered is one of complete and utter peace, I have had this experience recently and is to date the strongest and most humbling meditation experience I've had. Again there were no worries, restrictions or ego but in this experience unlike the last one I was consciously living the outcome instead of being in a bubble of thoughtlessness. It's not that this experience was better or worse than the bubble, it was just different. I cannot describe how great this feeling was, in fact I felt so good, so confident with everything, so at ease, like the world was perfect, I actual felt compelled to cease my meditation and continue on with my day as if this feeling had always been there and always would be. I was lifted into a state where the world was always perfect, good an kind. I did not think or feel any negative thoughts, or emotions or even have memories of them. I feel the lack of negative memories is what caused be to cease my meditation. I believed that that is how my day to day life was. The last state I will explain is about observing my own thoughts or my own mind (I'm not sure myself). I have experienced multiple times a feeling of observing my own mind. This comes when I've reached a point where not thinking about anything is now easy, when I've reached a stage where I am easily able to just sit and be conscious. I feel like I've slogged and dragged myself through the proverbial mud of thoughts and am now above it, free and easy to relax. I feel this state isn't as deep as the two mentioned previous but it is on it's way. Lastly, over my timing meditating I've came to the realisation that I do not need to word my thoughts for them to be thoughts, this may sound obvious but I do not mean it in the sense of remembering something or visualising imagery. I mean it in the sense that, for example, if I'm going over something in my mind, maybe trying to decide the pros and cons of something I'm wording it out in my mind; I'm internally talking to myself. I've realised that I don't need to do that, I can instead take the words out of the equation and just use my emotional consciousness to come to a conclusion. It's generally much faster as I actually know what the best outcome is already, the words are just slowing me down and allowing me to trick myself. It's almost like a mini meditation in a way because I'm putting out the thoughts and allowing my consciousness (me) to decide. After any good meditation session I 'wake up' feeling renewed, relaxed, cozy and level-headed. Because I've flushed out all negativity and nitpicking little thoughts I have no immediate worries or expectations, everything feels good. Slowly however as I remember or come across concerns of the real world, no matter how small, this feeling fades away and I am back to my regular self albeit holding onto what I have experienced and/or learnt during my meditation. Anyway, that is my experience so far summed up. I didn't include everything I've experienced but I didn't want this to be in unnecessary detail. It's also quite difficult describing these things, you really have to have your own experience. Obviously your experience will probably differ and you will have your own almost indescribable states. I didn't put a TL;DR because it is quite impossible to do that with this subject. Thank you for reading and please share your own experiences and revelations.",

Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed \"I can't! and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said \"I just want to die\" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying \"What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!\" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said \"I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart.\" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have nothing going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote \"I never meant to push anyone out, especially not you. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just...\" I then said \"Do we have a chance anymore, J?\" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying \"I don't know.\" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered \"I'm sorry\" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles...\nI know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even really express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today...\nI miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month.

    "input_text": "CD Projekt Red Co-Founder: \"I never played The Witcher 3\". Interview with M. Kiciski. ( x-post /r/games) **Daniel Maikowski: You're the co-founder and one of the main shareholders in CD Projekt, but for the past 5 years you haven't actively taken part in its business. Don't you miss the gaming world, which was an integral part of your life for so many years?** Micha Kiciski: Generaly speaking, I don't miss it. If there's a small grain of nostalgia, I open up some strategy game on an iPad and that's good enough for me. It's not that I lost all interest in video games. I still like them, but now I have many more interests and activities which are more interesting than playing. Back in the day I used to play all night long titles such as Diablo, Starcraft or Counter Strike, and then I had to recover lost health. Always, when I entered a video game world it completely disturbed my day-to-day life. I made a concious decision that there're equally interesting things, even more interesting than games, that simultaneously make me feel better - physically, psychically and emotionally. **You're not about to tell me, that you haven't played the newest Witcher?** I haven't. **Admittedly neither have I. Even though the game looks brilliant, I am overwhelmed by the fact, that in order to complete it, you have to invest dozens of hours.** That's exactly what I meant earlier. There comes a moment, when you have to make a decision, how you want to spend that dozens of hours of your life. At this stage, at which I am right now, I believe that the real world is just more interesting than the virtual one, even tho the latter can also be interesting and addicting. **The game industry is doing everything it can for us to dive deeper into the virtual reality. Nowadays the VR headsets, which are getting increasingly popular, cut the player from the real world even further. Are you not scared about that trend?** I myself used VR headsets and I think they're phenomenal. Games themselves are not a threat at all. It's all down to self-control and common sense. It's obvious, that every single thing taken to extreme/overused will hurt us. Regardless if we're talking about the video games, watching TV or even sports. **What do you think about the success of The Witcher 3?** I think that none of us expected such an unbelievable success of the game and CD Projekt itself. We're talking about a game, that has pretty much won every single award and accolade that you can in this industry. If we're to expect something more, it would be even better sales of the game. My brother Adam (CD Projekt's CEO) spoke about it at one of the investors conferences. The Witcher 3 was of course a gigantic commercial success, but in terms of sales there's still a lot of room for growth. CD Projekt's ambition is to catch up with the largest developers in the world in that area. **Is \"Cyberpunk 2077\" the game, which will allow you to reach that goal?** I think it's absolutely realistic. \" The Witcher\" was a fantastic material for a game, but it also constraint us. For startes, we're working with a story set in a fantasy world. Secondary, we're promoting a brand, that was mainly known in Central-Eastern Europe, and not in the west. I'm confident, that Cyberpunk 2077 can be a much bigger commercial success than \"The Witcher 3\". Futuristic world of the Cyberpunk is much closer to what we know from our daily lives. It's also much more popular, massive as you can tell by its presence in the films, books, comics and games. You have to remember, that fantasy is a much more niche topic. I believe, that in case of Cyberpunk, CD Projekt can fight not only for prestigious awards and accolades, but also for a huge commercial success. It's hard to achieve both of those in our industry, but it's perfectly doable, as shown by Rockstar and, in the past, Blizzard. **Blizzard was your role model?** Definitely. Even before CD Projekt started building games, we were Blizzard's distributors in Poland. We were impressed by their philosophy. Blizzard was putting quality over quantity. You had to wait years for their games, and almost every launch was a success both commercially and in terms of quality. Rockstar has now inherited that philosophy. That company works diligently on every game. They care about even the smallest detail. That results in not only great sales of their games, but also in player's trust. CD Projekt doesn't have any problem with that trust either. Our advantage over many other developer studios came from the fact, that we're raised competing with pirates. When we first published Baldur's Gates many years ago, our main competitor was the 10th-Anniversary Stadium (old communist stadium turned into a huge marketplace in he middle of Warsaw). We had to do everything to gain player's trust and offer them a product, that would be a better deal than a pirated copy. Our philosophy from the beginning was: pirate is just a mistreated client. **CD Projekt is not only a game developer, but also a very dynamic publicly traded company. The past year has been very successful and record-breaking for your company. Where's the ceiling?** I remember, that when we started our journey on the stock exchange, I told my friends that our shares can be worth even over 35 zloty ($8.61). They laughed. Today they're worth twice as much. It shows that even my very optimistic outlook turned out to be very pessimistic. Where's the ceiling? I don't know. I am confident that CD Projekt has extremely good perspectives. They're tied to Gwent and the upcoming launch of \"Cyberpunk 2077\". I don't want to state any numbers because that would just be speculation. **Some people even say, that the recent success of the Polish gaming companies is a stock market bubble...**\nCD Projekt's success, as well as the success of few other developers has definitely changed the way investors view our industry. It's a double-edged sword. Individual companies should be judged not by CD Projekt's achievement, but by their own successes and perspectives. I urge people to be careful. Achiving targets in the gaming industry isn't that simple as many may think. You can't assume that investing in the game industy is going to give you high returns. It may turn out, that - just like in every other industry - there are mismanaged companies. For that reason you have to first look at the numbers - financial and sale results, and only then good climate around the entire industry. **You hold almost 11% of CD Projekt, which makes you one of the main shareholders. Do you not have an urge to get involved?** I fully trust the entire management team of CD Projekt. I don't intend to interfere in their work. The company is in good hands. I am not only talking about the management, but also about the fantastic team, that has spent years building CD Projekt's success. **When can we expect the release of Cyberpunk 2077?** Ha ha ha... I know as much as any other person, so I just patiently wait. However, Adam has clearly stated during one of the conferences, that the period between the release date announcement and the launch itself may be very short. Creating a short - lets say 6 month - but intensive marketing campaign is a hard to achieve ideal. Only well respected companies that have appropriate financial resources can pull it off. It's sort of a communication blitzkrieg. You have to be well prepared, but you can win a lot. the rest of the interview was dedicated to the vegan restaurant that Kiciski is opening in Warsaw\n[Source (in Polish)](<URL>)",

I've run really slow, moderate pace, outside, inside, treadmill, track you name it. My heart rate always got up to 187bpm within a minute of running. I haven't run in probably 18 months. In those 18 months I have started and quelled a battle with anxiety. I've been on Celexa for 8 months now, and have not tried to run in those 8 months... until yesterday. A little background: husband and I started eating healthy, tracking food, and working out one week ago today. We both have confidence we are going to make it this time, and are taking it slowly, one day at a time. Yesterday was my leg day. I did my regular leg routine and just planned on walking with my husband on the treadmills for 30 minutes. I got bored after about 2 minutes of walking and decided to try a light jog, hesitant that my HR would shoot up and I wouldn't be able to breathe very well. Quite the contrary! My HR was at a max of 167, and I did intervals of running (90 seconds on, 2 minutes off). I wanted to cry. I'm now convinced I am able to run and will eventually be able to run a mile for the first time in my life. When that day comes I will be bawling in the middle of my gym. I feel like we're really going to make it this time.",

Hence 19 days with no food, and ending up in the hospital for seizures. All my step mom, (that is basically my mother since she and my father raised me since I was 2), was \"Why do you always have to learn things the the hardest way possible, I have tried to tell you numerous times about the importance of eating, but no, you had to go get yourself hospitalized for starvation.\" That didn't make me feel very good. Another friend besides the one who threatened to tell her mom told me that she has a room that I can move into and if she needs to treat me like one of her kids, she will. :( I never realized how many people cared what I do, even if I did it completely unintentionally, and didn't intend on killing myself through starvation. It's not like I intended on passing out in the middle of WM and being hauled off to the hospital. My truck was still in the WM parking lot when I was discharged, and I left the windows down and the keys in the ignition. Yes, my truck was still there, (but the interior was wet because it rained).

Unfortunately, my diagnosis came around when I was a young teen after being sexually, physically and mentally abused and sometimes this effects our sex life but we have this part under control.

It's only my sophomore year and I just want to sink into the floor. There are things I love like choir and dance team and musical but when it comes to actual classes I just want to lay in bed and cry. No kidding, all I want to do is sleep but I can't. All I can do is cry about it. I have two and a half years left and I feel so miserable. Why the hell is this so hard? I constantly feel like I'm letting someone down and my life is so full of stress I could explode. I cry all the time because I'm just so tired. Everyday I have commitments.

Normally, people who struggle with emotional stability (and can't stay happy) are told to do the things that they enjoy the very most when they start to feel under the weather psychologically, but my level of emotional sensitivity doesn't allow me to do that without often traumatic results. If anything at all goes wrong, it can and will ruin my mood at the moment, for the day, or even for the week. If a video-game session doesn't go exactly like I wanted, if the pizza I ordered isn't made the way I had hoped, if I want to play with my cat and she bites me because she wants to be left alone... things like these (mostly, but not always) make me want to crawl in a hole and cry, as if something tragic had happened. Living life for me is like tip-toeing around a field of landmines everywhere I go, which makes me want to do the only thing I know won't set off my anxiety-- lay in bed, in the dark, and do absolutely nothing. This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. Which seem like it will turn into a pipe dream soon, since I have no health insurance and can't afford any since I'm unemployed. I have no idea how to manage this.

    "input_text": "Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist - 2 So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. * I have to find my family!* One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units. According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you! ----------------\n**UPDATE**\nSo far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time. When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late. ----------\n**FINAL UPDATE**\nSo as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and \"earn my dinner\". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. * Where's my baby? Is she ok?* She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in. [](<URL>)",

    "input_text": "Why do you think you will ruin someone else's happiness? I think that feeling is probably a reflection of what your mom has taught you - that you somehow affect her feelings (i.e. your depression makes her feel unhappy so it must be your fault). It's not healthy to think that way, and it probably contributing to a lot of your depression. If you haven't looked into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) I would google it. One of the main concepts of CBT is that we process events and our brain decides how to respond to it. Do you notice how certain people respond differently to events? For example, say you did poorly on a test. I might respond by thinking that I'm a failure. This thought leads to feeling very depressed. This leads to me avoiding that class, subsequently doing worse and worse and confirming my belief that I'm a failure. Now, take someone else who is maybe more positive. They do poorly on the test. They say, well, it was really hard and I didn't study as much as I should have. So they think, it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a failure. I just need to study more. So they keep going to class, take good notes, and study for the next test, and do well. Do you see where I'm going with this? In the case of your mom, she reacts to the event of you being depressed or unhappy. She thinks, what happened to my happy boy? She probably thinks, maybe it's my fault he feels this way. I must be a terrible mother. These thoughts make her feel awful and depressed. She thinks, if only he was happy, I would be happy too. He's making me unhappy. BUT, if you look at this situation, SHE made herself unhappy by these thoughts. It's important to remember that. Don't let others make YOU feel like YOU made them feel a certain way. That was a big breaking point in my depression. It made me relax a bit. If someone is upset, that's their problem, not mine. I can't fix it. I didn't make them upset. If possible, I would look into therapy. If you can't afford therapy or don't want to, look into books on CBT. I like Feeling Good. I look at it from time to time. You can't change your family and how they react to you, but you can change how YOU react to what they say. You don't need to feel guilty for your depression because you did not choose to have it. I am on an SSRI and I have found that incredibly helpful. You can see a primary care physician and they will usually prescribe you an SSRI. If you're open to medication I would look into it! Good luck!",

    "input_text": "An Unsupportive Mother..??? Hey everyone, LTR,FTP and all that, on mobile. Im going to start this off with a little background; itll be two weeks ago this coming Monday that I had a surgical abortion (no, I did not want to- who really does ? but I am 100% pro choice, and given the fact that it was an accident, the result of a casual fling and I didnt even like the guy that much- best decision for me, yadda yadda). My friends who knew and my mother have been very supportive of my decision (father not so much, but hes old and crazy so I dont care- stories for another time). Or so I thought. Last Monday (a week post-procedure), I was at my mothers house for dinner. We were discussing the situation, my lack of side effects, how relieved I was and all that. NOW, just because Im relieved does not mean I am happy. I am feeling very lonely, and angry (she knows) that the father gets to go about pretending it didnt happen, no effects on him, etc. I was telling her my feelings on this when she throws out this gem; Well, you know I dont believe in abortion, but I support- Perhaps my reaction was childish, but I was so hurt that I didnt even let her finish. I pushed my chair back and said I am going home now. She argued against it, saying I didnt understand what she meant, how she meant it, etc. But how could I have misinterpreted that? Everyone is allowed their opinions, of course. Im not begrudging her that. But to say that to your DAUGHTER who had just gone through this rather traumatizing experience a week earlier, I thought it rather thoughtless. I immediately called a cab and went to wait in the lobby. I dont see how she can say she doesnt believe in abortion at all, but truly supports me . While I was waiting for the cab she texted me ; I didn't mean anything against your decision. You just don't understand where I'm coming from when I say that. I was actually greatly relieved by you decision. I replied Shut the fuck up, I do not want to talk to you. I dont give a flying eff what you meant. Now a couple hours later I felt really horrible for cursing her out. I never speak to her that way, ever, since she has such a terrible time with my younger sister. I texted and apologized for cursing her out, but made it clear how much she hurt me and how why she said was thoughtless and ill-timed, etc. She didnt reply til the next day when she said I cant deal with this right now. I replied That is selfish. You are the one who hurt my feelings by saying something extremely insensitive. If you werent my mother and said that my reaction wouldve probably been a hell of lot worse. And now you are trying to punish me by refusing to talk to me. That really helps the situation. ( Yes I know my reactions were not mature, and I feel bad for that, but at the time I just felt so sad and angry that one of the only people who I thought was a solid support system appeared to not be as truthful with that as she originally claimed) Then she cane back to me with this I don't want to hurt you anymore. I feel so bad. But just need time to get over what I did. I think I got my point across that what she said hurt my feelings, but am I wrong to think that that response is rug sweeping? I didnt reply to that and then last night she texts me asking if I still want to go to an uncles retirement party. I ask what time and said okay. But then the more I thought of it I got angry that the first thing she said to me on almost three days was to ask if I wanted to still go to the party. No genuine apology. So I said Know what, I dont know if I feel up to going with you and (sister) tomorrow. the first thing you say to me in three days after refusing to speak to me, even though you were the one to upset me after speaking to me in the way you did, is to ask if Im still going to that party? That feels like rug-sweeping. That really wasnt what you shouldve said first. I want a sincere apology fully admitting you were in the wrong, and I havent gotten it. Until I do, I dont want to come around. Im sorry if that comes across mean, but its how I feel, and my feelings are valid. I do not think the intent was there to hurt my feelings, of course I dont think youd ever do that on purpose. That doesnt take away the fact that it did. Im over it now but I want a proper apology. No reply yet as I sent it from work on a night shift. I am willing to take constructive criticism on how I should handle this from here. Thoughts on how I am handling it and how my mother is handling it. I know I shouldve thought before my initial responses, and kept my cool, but I did not. I know that wasnt the right way to handle it, that I shouldve waited til I cooled down. I cant take that aspect back now, though. I apologize if this is all over the place. Im internally struggling right now and just needed to vent to unbiased third parties. Edit: just incase anyone was wondering, I did copy and paste the texts in to this post. None of it was paraphrasing. I wouldve posted imgur links but Ive never really posted anything like that before, and its also 530 am here and so Im too tired to learn that atm",

    "input_text": "My life is still too complicated I've changed my life completely in the past 9 years; went from a corporate retail job to being a freelance writer, moved from a 3/2/1 house to eventually this 520 sf apartment. I went from 1/4 acre lot to about 250 sf of garden space. I no longer own a car, so walk, bus and ride a bike (hadn't been on one in 20 years before this) everywhere. I spend less then $200 a month for food most months. I have very, very few clothes (down from two closets full previously), one good pair of jeans, and one good pair of walking shoes. Yesterday, I got tired of washing eating utensils, so I put away all but 2 of everything except I kept out 9 spoons, because that's mostly what I eat with. I don't really need 9 spoons, but I don't want to have to keep washing them all day, so 9 it is. I share a small community garden plot close by, and I've gotten to where I hate going there, because it's just one more chore I have to do. I had huge plans for planting my courtyard but instead, I've decided to lay out an area for a few favorite plants, then fill the rest in with mulch because it's just something I have no interest in anymore. I sometimes pick up things I think I'll eventually need or can use from beside the apartment dumpsters, but lately, I've been taking dumpster finds back out to the dumpster, because I want space more than I want stuff. I think a lot about getting rid of it all and going to live in a van, traveling around the country, because I've never really seen the U.S. due to no money to travel. I don't know how long I could do that, but every time I have to do a deep clean of the apartment because it's gotten a little out of hand, I think how nice it must be only to have a tiny little van full of the essentials of life. Just now, while I was watering my indoor plants, I thought \"I should just give all of these away. What good are they to me, really?\" Plants and gardening used to be my life, and now it just seems like work. It's all just so much to take care of! My neighbor was shocked I don't have a washer and dryer, and I told her it's just one more thing to break and have to get fixed. She didn't understand how I can stand going to the laundry room to do my laundry, but I explained to her that I have so few clothes and linens now that I can do it all in two loads once a week. I wish I could do it in one. If I lived in a van, I could do it in one. I look at everything in here every day and think \"I don't need this or that or that or ...\" you get the idea. I have 5 frying pans. Who the hell needs 5 frying pans? I used to love my things, and to a point, I still do, but more and more, they are just things to take care of and things that require space that I don't want to clean and take care of. If I didn't have all these things, I wouldn't need all this space. Am I going insane, or does anyone else feel this way?",

    "input_text": "Judging by the message I found, someone, somewhere, is lonelier than I am... Statistically, somewhere in the early hours of Christmas morning, more people are asleep than at any other moment during the year. I'm working. And I love that the world is quiet. That's less people to bother me, and more thickness for the walls of darkness and solitude that surround this place. As the off-hours network manager, I'm typically alone in my duties, and I don't have to *manage* much of anything. I don't have to train people, or deal with customer issues. All I have to do is make sure our extremely expensive network doesn't go down or lock up or implode when nobody else is around. With today's technology, that means I spend the vast majority of my time sitting around and browsing things online. I'm pretty sure I've seen the entire Internet. I used to cover my tracks by deleting my connection history from the network log, but, one week I forgot and nobody cared. I quickly got the sense that nobody was even looking, and, if they did, they wouldn't give a crap about the browsing history of the off-hours network manager. I mean, realistically, what else was I supposed to do? Cooped up in this half-dark, half-rainbow server room, alive with the breath of endless banks of computers and the cooling system needed to keep it all from melting I used to joke to myself that my ultimate responsibility here was to literally pull the plugs out of the walls if the air conditioning ever stopped working, something no software could ever do, and something a monkey could have managed - but my little joke ceased being funny when I realized that was actually, probably, most likely the case. I'm a glorified button pusher. Once I'd seen the entire Internet, I grew bolder. I began looking at files on our own network. I had excuses lined up if anybody came to ask what I was doing but nobody ever did. We did quite a bit of work with military contractors, and it was rather astounding to sift through bid documents, designs, and plans that dealt in the billions of dollars. It was all protected and encrypted, of course except I was the acting network administrator. Score one for the network being far too big for anyone to lock down perfectly. There were files, emails, and logged communications from practically everywhere, and a few places I'd never even heard of. We weren't military, or governmental, but we did business with them all. VPs discussed third-world coups over lunch, accountants logged tax tricks that were clearly illegal but heavily obfuscated and ready to be pinned on patsies hired for the task of taking the fall, and soldiers emailed their families back home. That was the thing about these memos and emails. Unlike the swarm of crap on the Internet, they were *real.* One soldier's email chain ended two months ago, and the subsequent data linked to his widow trying to get money out of our insurance department despite their best efforts to renege on the payout. These were *real people* being churned through the system. Was that widow asleep somewhere right now, ready to fake her way through Christmas morning with her daughter, or was she still awake, with anger and despair gnawing at her? I mean, I had access and the system was the system and I knew it was inevitable. Alone in here ad infinitum, I'd eventually do it. Why not now? I closed the widow's insurance payout ticket, taking it away from the current person assigned to it, then reopened it without an assignee a simple matter. With a few manipulations, I created a fake employee in a department with a redundant sounding title. Then, I sent it on over to pay processing doubled the amount and marked it as Approved. It was nothing to a gigantic corporation, but everything to a single person. As a final act, I deleted all traces of my actions. That was it. Maybe what I'd done was illegal, but it seemed the morally right thing to do. She'd be getting an email confirmation before she woke up. That seemed like a Christmas present and a half. And I couldn't be caught, in any case. There was simply no trace in the system that I'd had *anything* to do with it, and hardly anybody knew I existed anyway. The system was the system, and if, through some impossible feat, a mid-level manager noticed an issue, he'd simply pass a ticket up to me. And that ticket would most certainly be lost in the shuffle. I felt oddly great for a little while, until I realized everyone's asleep. If ever I had an opportunity to do more like this, and get away with it, it was now. I delved deeper into the files, looking specifically for military communications with signs of distress. Somehow, I think I knew it the moment I saw it. The message log hung there in emptiness - alone, like me. Nobody had read it, and nobody was even aware of its existence. It was encrypted in a unique way, and hidden by rare system priorities. No users had the rights to access it, and the file had no traceable origin. This was a message intended to be read by no one. But the access process *did* exist within the system, even if nobody actually had the rights to it. I couldn't resist. ---\n0110111101110101011101000110011101101111011010010110111001100111001000000110001101101111011011\n0101101101011101010110111001101001011000110110000101110100011010010110111101101110001000000110\n1111011011100110110001111001\nYou'd be surprised how easy it is to play chess against yourself. The game is uniquely suited to cold decision-making, and your next move doesn't depend on prior states. You can spend a few hours reading a book, come back to the board, and legitimately make a move in your own best interests before doing it all again as the opposite player. Of course, your opponent is perfectly matched to your level of skill, and there's no bragging, so nothing really gets decided. I did find, curiously, that black won more than fifty percent of the time\nAt some point, I'm pretty sure the human brain forces you to stop doing things you realize are pointless. Once chess became agony instead of welcome distraction, I had only the books left. And when I'd memorized all the books, I\nI went for a lot of walks. They don't take very long, though. I've got seven chambers here. One has the shower and the toilet, and the marks I make in the wall for each day that passes. One chamber has my bed, my books, and a picture on a nightstand. The third chamber has a kitchen area, and a table that serves adequately as a ping-pong arena against my only opponent - the wall. The fourth chamber has the computers and communication equipment. Screw all this stuff. It's all held together by rubber bands and scotch tape. You know, I think I've finally managed to send a message out somewhere but I always think that, don't I? This time, with everything going unbounded, with time slipping into time and thought slipping into thought I really think I've done it. This message is going *somewhere.* It has to be. The fourth chamber has a wall of televisions and radios, incoming-only. Some goddamn genius got hired to make televisions and radios that couldn't be repurposed to send a message out. I *hate* that guy. I've been in and out of half of these things, even burrowed into the wall myself, and the crap back there just won't give me a break. I used to watch the TVs, but they just remind me how cooped up I am. And everyone out there seems to be getting dumber and more outraged at everything all the time. I wish I could shout loud enough for them to hear. The fifth chamber has, of all things, a couch. What am I gonna do, *have a guest over?* There are fake blinds, too, always down and closed because they only show onto concrete. Was this room supposed to make me feel a little less trapped? Idiots\nThe sixth chamber, offset a bit from the rest by a small tunnel, houses a vast little factory and furnace room that keeps me alive. Air conditioning, carbon scrubbing, an automated hydroponics bay, geothermal power plant, the works that shit could run for a hundred years all by itself, if it hadn't been made by the lowest bidder. See, I know I'm not supposed to send messages out. I *know that.* That's the fundamental design of this whole place. Thing is there's somebody down here. I mean, I might be losing my mind. I get that. But I can feel the curve of insanity ahead in the road, and I don't think I'm there yet. I really think there's a person in my furnace room. And I *checked.* I went over every crack in the wall, every nook and cranny in the air vents, even re-checked the welded-shut elevator like I do every day: there's no way in or out of this place. Yet, there's someone in my furnace room. I can guess what that means for me, and none of my guesses are good. I suppose there's no point in hiding, though. There's literally nowhere to go. And I chose this, so it's pretty much my fault. Time to face the music and, more supposing - better to die now than to spend forever down here losing my mind. Actually, not like anyone will get this message in time to do anything. I might as well check it out first. I crept down that long, small concrete tunnel with the weirdest sense of anticipation. The furnace room had always creeped me out for some reason; it wasn't meant for anything but maintenance access, so it was like a series of mechanical caves and burrows that went on longer than I'd ever reached. It was always breathing and moving and clinking, even during my supposed night hours. I hated it. So, *of course,* an intruder had to have appeared there. Anywhere else would have been too simple. Crawling between the water recycler and a furnace duct, I tried to get a long vantage on whoever was back there. I froze as I saw a shoe move out of sight up ahead. Scraping across cement, it had been pulled forward by someone else crawling through the maintenance tubes. That was it: proof that someone was down here. Was *was there a way out?* \"Hello?!\" I shouted, immediately taken aback at the ragged and unfamiliar sound of my own voice. The only response came in the form of someone scrambling away in the distance. \"Please, I won't hurt you,\" I yelled out. Eventually, I retreated back to the tunnel. If there *was* somebody in there, they'd have to come out sooner or later. I pulled the couch over, tilted it up on its end, and used it as a makeshift barrier in the tunnel. It could easily be moved - but it would make a noise. I moved through my chambers carefully, noting the placement of every object. Nothing had been moved, and I could find nobody around, so the possible intruder still had to be in the furnace room\nI decided to get some algae paste from the kitchen and eat. There was really nothing else to do. I couldn't risk crawling around in there with some stranger on the loose here, I'd at least have a clear view of what I was up against. The alarm went off as I was eating. Distracted as I was by the thought of an impossible intruder, I was initially terrified but, then, I sighed, and went to deal with it. How long did I wait? A half hour? It didn't matter. Eventually, a voice radiated down the tunnel. \" In the kitchen, I sat up straight. It was a woman! Practically running to the sixth chamber access, I poked my head around the edge of the couch. \" How'd you get down here?\" I didn't see anybody, but her voice came from right around the opposite corner at the end of the tunnel. \" Where are we? What is this place?\" Processing her words, my head hurt a little bit. It'd been a long time since I'd heard anyone speak. All that mattered was getting out of here \"How'd you get in here?\" Whoever she was, she paused. \" I'll tell you, but only if you tell me where we are.\" Court-martial me if I ever get out of here - what was the use of hiding the information? \" We're eleven thousand feet underground.\" Another pause, then a confused tone. \" Seriously?\" I could leave, I could leave, and I could start a new life \"How do we escape?\" \"Just one second,\" she replied instead, her tone growing more commanding. \" What is the state of Earth?\" I sighed. It was just an overseer using the comm system to simulate an intruder. Had I imagined the shoe? Or perhaps it was an adjunct, testing me. I hadn't heard from any of them in over a year, but they'd been bound to check in sooner or later \"Looks like business as usual in the TVs. Radio chatter seems normal, too. A few wars going on, but nothing out of the ordinary.\" \"Is that so?\" She stepped out from behind her corner hesitantly. Holy crap - she *was* really down here! A brown-haired woman in her early thirties crept down the tunnel. She wore unfamiliar clothing, but seemed otherwise normal. \" You're not armed, are you?\" I looked her in the eyes across the edge of my couch. \" Why would I be armed? No one should be able to get down here.\" She approached me cautiously, and I retreated a chamber. She slowly moved the couch out of the way and entered my space proper. As she looked at me, I suddenly felt very self-conscious about my thickening stubble and unkempt hair. \" Sorry,\" I told her. \" I haven't had visitors in a long time.\" She circled around me, checking out each chamber with narrowed eyes one by one. Though I followed her from room to room, she never completely turned her back to me. We stopped outside my bedroom, and she did not enter the bathroom area. \" What is this place?\" \"My prison,\" I laughed. \" Can we go now?\" \"Are you a prisoner? What was your crime? What justifies burying you eleven thousand feet down?\" It occurred to me that she really had no idea where she was. This wasn't an act. What if she chose not to reveal her method of entry? \" Oh oh no, I was joking. I'm I'm military.\" She set her jaw. I don't think she believed me. \"Here, come here,\" I told her, going back to the fifth chamber. \" These TVs I watch the world here.\" I touched a device. \" I listen to the radios see?\" She remained at the edge of the chamber, watching me warily. \" What could I tell her? Hmm \"There's a problem, see. It, um it's like this. Say there's aliens. They want to take over the Earth for whatever reason. They're assholes, right? Except if they've got brains, they'll understand.\" \"Understand what?\" She slowly moved around the edge of the room, drifting toward the direction of the furnace room tunnel. I could tell I was losing her. \" Say there are monsters, too. Shit, I don't know. Mind-controlling parasites. Things with eerie eyes that'll eat you alive. Or one that, like, rips out of your *bones.* Your bones. Fates worse than death. Anything and everything.\" Her eyes went narrower, and she stiffened. I told her, highly aware of her body language. \" I'm not saying this stuff exists. * I* don't know. Some people do, though, and some people are scared out of their goddamn minds. So if I see, on the TV, that people are in trouble that those aliens are attacking, or stuff is *getting* people, or anything that seems to be condemning the human race to fates worse than death well, then I give them the better option. I give them *just death.*\" The glimmer of understanding grew in her eyes. I decided to push the offensive. \" I can tell you get it. Aliens can't take us over if we threaten to kill ourselves rather than surrender. And we can't be trapped in fates worse than death if we kill ourselves first.\" I moved along the wall, touching embedded electronics. \" All this all this it's attached to every single nuclear weapon in every single country all over the world.\" \"That's why you're so far down,\" she breathed, taking in the logical madness. \" None of those forces can find you, or reach you. They can't stop you from activating the doomsday suicide pact.\" I nodded excitedly, my eyes wide. \" That's what he said, when he brought me down here. * The only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice.* That's our mantra.\" I thought about that, and my hope slowly began to ebb as I realized something. \" If you're not with them, then who are you? I haven't heard from my commanding officer in over a year.\" \"The TVs look fine\" she answered. \"They could be faked,\" I countered. \" They're just signals. If the politicians told the enemy - whoever or whatever the enemy is - and the politicians *would* have told them, because the doomsday suicide pact is useless unless the enemy knows about it - you know, Doctor Strangelove style - then those signals could easily be fake. Everyone on the surface could be dead right now, or being kept alive as brains in jars, or being enslaved.\" \"Then how do you know anything at all about the situation up there?\" I glared at her. \" My CO is supposed to check in every so often over a secure line. I haven't heard from him in over a year. The equipment *broke.* Goddamn government contractors! But I fixed it. I thought I fixed it. But he's still not out there.\" She looked down at my uniform for a moment, thinking. \" If the signals are being faked, then the enemy up there has complete control of the planet, and masterful deception abilities. In that situation, would you detonate the system and destroy all life on the surface?\" I nodded. \" In a heartbeat. If They killed everyone, or enslaved them, or worse... well then They can all go to hell.\" \"What if there are still human beings fighting for survival?\" she asked, her tone quiet. \" What if there's even one person left up there?\" I smiled weakly. \" All thoughts that I've had. In an endless mad cycle. Over and over. The fate of the world literally rests on me.\" My gaze drifted. \" Can you please take me out of here?\" My hope rekindled in a burst of warm fire as she finally just nodded. \"Alright. No man should ever have to make that choice, let alone by himself.\" Almost sobbing, I nodded in agreement. She began to move toward the access tunnel when red lights began to blare and a loud noise echoed through the chambers. \" What the hell is that?\" Why did it have to happen *then?* I was almost out! Despair coiling around my heart, I carefully walked to the seventh chamber in my underground bunker. The heavy metal doors slid open in response to my handprint, and a single button lay within. Above, large red numbers counted down. 21 20 19\nComing up behind me, she studied the room, and shouted over the alarms. \" What *is* this?\" I said nothing. Instead, I pushed the button. The alarms ceased, and the chamber slowly resealed itself. Standing outside, I could only look at the cold concrete beneath my bare feet. She figured it out on her own. \" It's not something you activate, is it?\" she asked, her words horrified. \" It's something you *don't do.*\" I nodded absently. \" The alarm goes off at random three times a day. I have sixty seconds to push the button and stop the process. If I'm dead - if the forces worse than death have managed to disable or kill me - then it'll go off automatically. That's the only way to be sure.\" She backed away from me. \" I can't take you with me\" She began moving down the service tunnel backward, her eyes on me, as I slowly followed her. \" God I can't take you with me how long have you been down here?\" She'd have known if she saw the bathroom, and the thousands of marks on the walls that each marked a single day. She shook her head for nearly ten seconds, probably trying to comprehend what she was condemning me to. \" I'm so sorry\" She slammed the door to the furnace room behind her. Just like that, I was alone again. Had I ever really had company? Had I ever really *had a guest over?* I did eventually manage to get through the door, but there was no trace of her by then, and no trace of an escape route. I knew, then, that I was going insane. What if the signals are fake? What if they're not? What if there's *one single person* still alive and fighting for the fate of the human race? What if there isn't, and I'm alone on a dead world? What if the surface is covered in slimy, horrible, extradimensional creatures? What if it's a utopia up there, and some horrific series of bad-luck mishaps have cut off the line to my bunker? They could be drilling down to rescue me even now - if I just had a single communication, a single message, a single voice if I just knew *something!* But I didn't know. And I couldn't go on. Court martial me if you can. I decided to let the timer run out at the next alarm. I sat there staring at the button, letting the alarms blare, letting the red lights flash. I held the picture from my nightstand close. 10 9 8\nI wouldn't even notice a difference down here, would I? The surface could be obliterated by a hundred thousand nuclear explosions, and I wouldn't feel a thing eleven thousand feet down, would I? 3 2 1\nI took in a deep gasp as the timer actually hit zero, and a much louder alarm began going off. Deep in the walls, something began to move, vibrating the concrete beneath my feet. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, it was actually happening! A single number blinked on the screen above. 0 0 0\nWhat now? Oh God, what now? The words *Final System Initiation* flashed above, and then new numbers appeared. 60 59 58\nSo it wasn't really only sixty seconds! I thought that was always cutting it a little short. I laughed out loud, barely hearing myself over the incredibly loud alarms. What was the louder alarm even *for?* There was no way to sleep through the first set unless\nThe proximity alarms\nThe vibrating beneath my feet\nWhy would anything vibrate *here?* Running out to the other chambers, I heard a loud drilling sound coming from somewhere above. Dust drifted down from the ceiling. They were drilling me out! Were they bringing down my replacement? Was my shift finally over?! Breathing hard, I ran to the button and slammed my hand down on it. It stopped at 6 seconds. The alarms all ceased, and the door to the seventh chamber slid closed once more. Laughing happily, I moved back out into the other rooms. I frowned. The drilling had stopped. It was eerily quiet once again. Confused, I waited. It wasn't until I'd done the same thing for two more alarms that I realized what you bastards did. You added fake proximity alarms and fake drilling vibrations to the final initiation. They're randomized, too, so I can never be certain they're fake. Every time I feel like giving up and letting the end come, letting all the bombs go bright I can't. Because maybe *this time* I'm being rescued at the last second. Maybe *this time* the drills are real. I laugh a lot these days. I'm laughing all the time! The woman could have been a hallucination, or not; the signals could be fake, or not; the rescue could be the same old trick, or not - who knows?! It's the ultimate joke! And you've played it on *me!* If you want to know how I feel about it, you know where to find me! I'll be here, screaming your names! A Merry Christmas to all of you, straight from hell! And I'm here in the flames already, waiting for you, laughing\n---\nI finished reading the message log with a terrible sinking feeling in my heart. What the hell was this? Some kind of joke? The file's details said it had been made today. In fact, the last few lines had been added *as I'd read it.* But where was it coming from? Where did this file originate? This couldn't possibly be real, could it? Was there a poor and tortured madman underneath the Earth right now, with the power to destroy everything at his fingertips? I could imagine some sort of ridiculous budget cutback eliminating the department that had overseen him. If the project had been kept secret, would anyone even know what had been defunded? Holy crap I couldn't find the source all I could do was hope that this was a Christmas joke being played on me for my off-hours browsing habits or, if it was real I could only hope that this unknown soul would hold out. And for how long? Indefinitely? Did all our lives hinge on the lonely suffering of one solitary man? In my half-dark and very isolated server room, I couldn't help but feel for him.

    "input_text": "It's like you're me, but me from a year ago. FH and I got engaged 12-19-15. We're getting married in September, so not completely two years but it has certainly felt like it. A long engagement has its pros and cons - the positives being more time to plan, more availability with venues, more time to save money, and more time to really fine tune what you want. I was very cool and blas about the whole thing at first. I kind of wanted a longer engagement anyway. But I got overconfident and thought \"I'll have plenty of time!\" and now I'm planning a majority of my wedding with four months to go. The extra time can absolutely feel like ages. Mentally, it seems totally reasonable to wait another few months, what's another few months in the long run, blah blah. But oh man can it get on your nerves. I wanted to be married by this last winter. We picked through venues (we live in LA but wanted a very outdoorsy wedding up a mountain and wanted somewhere that we could have the venue for the whole weekend instead of just a single day) and I basically gave up for a while. I was convinced we were never going to get married. After many, uh, unique (insane) google search terms, I stumbled upon our venue. It's everything I wanted and it's so pretty and charming it makes me want to puke. The people who own it are literally the nicest people I've ever met. I didn't find them on wedding wire or the knot or any of the specialty sites. I just started changing up my search terms, I think I found these guys through some kind of combo of \"wedding photography blog southern california mountain weekend trees\". Went through the image searches. A photographer's blog about a pretty wedding they shot is what lead me to the venue. A beautiful photo of a field near the ceremony spot. I felt like crying. I had been engaged eight months at that point and was so disheartened. I was set on this place without even seeing it in person. Once I'd found the name, I went ham on searching for more wedding blogs with pictures. It is three hours from home - not quite 3,000 miles, but still requires a hefty drive for most things - and it's not at all in the area I thought I would find something. But it is perfect. Point being, it WILL happen. I pinky promise. And it will be super annoying to feel like you're waiting forever sometimes, but you'll be grateful for the extra time, too. Enjoy being engaged. Get creative with your search. Think about how feasible it would be for you to organize vendor meetings - might require a trip for tastings but most information is easily passed on through email or skype. Think about doing an all-inclusive venue if there are any in the area - then you can see if you can do a single visit, if you love it, one more visit might do it. I'm guessing you'd be planning farther away because that's where family is - do you have any family there that could run errands for you? Trust someone's opinion on cake? That's another option. Sorry this turned into an essay. I had coffee for the first time in two months, lol, but also I just have Feelings about long engagements and finding the right place.",

    "input_text": "Feeling guilty, regretful, and ashamed over what feels like a wasted 5 years I just really need to say something, its eating me up and I have nowhere else to turn. So here it is, 5 years ago soon after I graduated high school I suffered a lower back injury from weight lifting. It was the only thing I had that gave me confidence, after a few months I started to feel depressed. I spent months laid up in bed, after finally getting a bone scan after 6 months the doctor told me I was healed and that I needed to do planks to feel better but I didnt care by then. After the next 6 months I tried to distract myself, or find reasons to try to motivate me to rehab that injury but nothing really worked. I tried the planks a little at some point and felt somewhat better, fooled myself into thinking I could handle workout routines I used to do, 0-60 real quick instead of pacing myself and just kept hurting myself every time. Idk why, ego? Damaged pride? Parents never understood every time I tried to say I felt mentally and physically unwell and that I didnt know what to do, and they just kept saying get a job as if that was a cure all. I tried hanging out with friends and drinking, which ended up injuring my knee one night. Eventually friends all went separate ways over the years and Ive felt alone for so long. I was ashamed of not working like everyone else my age but just felt incapable of doing it, I felt more helpless than ever. Parents kept preaching at me about work, I eventually tried a job for a year to just get away from my parents most of the day and to see if that would finally motivate me properly. i was always mentally and physically tired, unmotivated and slowly over time that toxic workplace made me feel like my best was never enough. I quit and told myself I saved up enough money to get me by until I was going to address these injuries and finally move on with my life. During this time the girl I was seeing of 5 months eventually cheated on me. And after 4 months of sulking over her I had sex with a different girl to try and make me forget about her, which led to getting molluscum contagiosum on my genitals but at the time I feared it was something far worse. I was 20 and felt like my life was over before it really got started, I was so scared ashamed and embarrassed. I felt defeated again and again no matter what I did. Gave up, lost hope. But then I mustered up what little courage I had left to go to the doctor, they said they could only do bloodwork and couldnt do physical exams, and that I should go elsewhere to get it looked at. But i wasnt thinking straight, just shaking from the fear and embarrassment. All I could think about was leaving as soon as possible and shutting myself back in my house. I was already there and told her about it, I said just take the blood. I didnt even want to consider more people knowing about it. Results came back a month or so later, everything was negative so it was nothing serious and that relieved me a bit. So I spent weeks on webmd trying to self diagnose myself instead of getting a physical exam like I should have. I just didnt want to be seen at all because I was so ashamed. So I fooled myself into thinking If I wait maybe itll go away in a few months like webmd says and so I waited. A few months pass and its almost my 21st birthday and I was so lonely, no one tried to ever talk to me or see how I was. Felt like my parents gave up on me, almost felt like strangers in the same house, and the rest of my family isnt that close. I stayed inside for almost a year not really doing anything but watching porn, using internet and playing video games. I had no sense of urgency or concept of time, I didnt value or appreciate anything. I didnt care. I couldnt try to reach out to anyone because I felt like there wasnt anyone I could reach to, and Ive never been good about opening up in the first place about personal things. It almost felt like I wasnt real, like nothing was. And everything felt impossible, even the smallest tasks felt like a chore. I hated myself for being so weak and not being strong enough to to the right things. I just couldnt, idk why. I felt like a disappointment and a burden. Sometimes I felt like my suffering wasnt enough to say I was depressed and felt like a loser hiding behind an excuse. I was numb. Time flew by in a blur, after I turned 21 something in me just snapped and I felt, hysterical? I felt like this wasnt right, that it shouldnt be like this. As if something had to be done. A realization that nobody was coming to save me and I had to start thinking and doing for myself. I needed change. I immediately went and got those pesky bumps taken care of, though it took a little longer than it should have. But after that I felt so stupid for being sacred about it all those months prior. I took this realization into 2019, and started trying to finally fix my body. There were set backs, those pains got worse because I sat around for a year doing nothing. And I had stomach pains I never had before that wouldnt go away for over a month, these things discouraged me a bit and that helplessness started to return. My grandmother passed away around this time and it didnt really hurt, so much as it reminded me that life is short and could end at anytime. And that I should try things more and over think less. I went to the doctor again and got checked out, I got a job for a month and got laid off, I tried dating again but ended things early on. These things made me feel alive again, short yet taught me so much compared to previous years. I realized I have so much more of myself to work on and live for. And after delaying it for awhile I set up my wisdom tooth surgery. After the surgery I found that I have courage. And finally around my 22nd birthday I started to workout and rehab my body, and still currently am (unfortunately taking longer than I had hoped). Still feel like I shouldnt work yet until Ive prioritized and ironed out things mentally and physically. Slowly after each little victory my mental health got better. Only in recent months have I started to see and think clearly for the first time in my life, I have genuine confidence. Things that once seemed impossible seem possible. However, like the title says, with this clarity I only am now seeing how I couldve did things differently. How it shouldve been, how if maybe I did 1 or 2 things different maybe things wouldve been better sooner. Maybe Id be further along in life. Im seeing all my old classmates moving on, and here I am stuck in the same place from 5 years ago. Guilt, shame, regret over wasted time. Lost experiences and opportunities in my youth. All I want to do is make up for it, if I can. Im eager and ready, but my body isnt. And the last thing I want is to rush out before it is. And its frustrating. I feel like Im on a time table, and just want to live hard and fast but cant because Im still limited. I wish I wouldve prioritized my body sooner, so I couldve worked more, saved more money and had more options. I dont want to be a failure anymore. I dont know how to quit dwelling on the past, its like Im constantly grieving. Anyways, if you made it all the way through this thank you for taking the time to read my story",

    "input_text": "The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake \"Hollywood\" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell.",

I would also try my best to tire myself out throughout the day so at night I would be so tired I could just try to sleep a little easier. I was prescribed trazadone and that helped me some nights too.

    "input_text": "Meth psychosis. Baaad trip. I talked briefly about this in another thread the other day and it had been a long time since I had thought about it. So I thought it may help someone if i tell this story. This happened to me almost 20 years ago now. 20 years later its still vivid in my mind it was so traumatic. The back story. In 1998 i moved from smoking pot to doing crystal methamphetamine. I remember the first few times, I felt like a God. I felt like I had discovered some secret. That the rest of humanity were weaker beings needing to sleep. I was full of life. Full of confidence and social. When I ended the nights out and went home, id lie there so wired i couldnt even blink. In my head running over fantasy scenarios and dreaming whilst awake. Dawn would come and id drop off to sleep. I had dropped out of work and was living off benefits which I used completely to buy crystal. It felt so good. This carried on for a while, I got confident, got a girlfriend. I hadn't had one for a few years (im an ugly bastard!). My confidence spiralled into egotistical wankerdom. I believed the grains of white crystal i held in my pocket were magic. Then one night this illusion swung violently into a nightmare...\nThat night. I hadn't slept or eaten anything proper in days. I was wired to fuck already. I met my girlfriend, who in reality was a drugged up skank from a rough family and we went to this shitty local pub she liked. I went into the toilets and thinking \"this place is shit, I'll liven it up about\", I took out my baggy and proceeded to bomb double what I usually took. It seemed to hit almost instantly. I was in the cubicle and the rush was pure terror and anxiety. I sat there and heard a few guys come into the toilet. They were talking about me. They were plotting to beat me up. I sat there with my heart pounding and eyes bulging thinking what will I do? What will I do...\nI go out cautiously and there is nobody there. I go into the pub area and my mates are playing pool and drinking. I try to pretend im ok but it must have been so obvious i wasnt. As one of my friends commented \"you need to calm down on that stuff\". My girlfriend said \"let's get out of here you look crazy\". So we went to her house which was just over the road. She said \"ill make you a brew to help you calm down\". I sat there and my mind was racing. She was in on it. I never drink brews. She was trying to poison me. Or slip me some downers so the people in the pub could beat me up. I sat in the lounge on my own. And looking around i saw some tools her dad had out, he was installing laminate floor. There was a hammer and a few other bits. Then I saw it. A retractable Stanley knife. I picked it up quietly and slipped it into my pocket. Not even thinking what the fuck I was going to do. I just knew if these fuckers came. I was going to defend myself. My girlfriend came in and gave me the brew. I put it down and obviously didn't drink that poisoned shit. The curtains were drawn, but I saw the shadows outside of a group of people. They were coming. I needed to get the fuck out of there. My girlfriend starts coming on to me. I pretended i was into it. seizing the element of surprise i push her off, jump up and shoot out of her house. I sprinted the fastest i have ever ran. Her house overlooked some fields at the back that led onto woods. I just ran and ran and ran. Once I was a good distance away i looked back and they were coming. I saw them coming. So I turned and carried on sprinting. On that night I think I'd have given Ussain Bolt a run for his money. I reached the woods and literally felt sick at the thought of going in. It must have been agouti midnight now and it was pitch black. There was no place else to go. I hurdled the fence and ran in. I found a densely overgrown spot and hid behind a tree. My heart pounding in my chest. My hand in my pocket slid out the blade of the knife...\nI stayed quiet for what seemed like hours. I saw them. Theirs dark silhouettes and hooded heads. They looked big. Like body builder types. And there were loads of them. I heard them whistle to each other in some sort of code. Then the worst thing ever happened. The clouds cleared and the full moon shone bright light down, illuminating the woods and revealing where I was. I saw them moving between trees. They were playing a game. They were hunting me. \"just get it over with!!... what have I done to you??.....why are you doing this !\" I screamed into the dark. But still they didn't come. They just sort of circled around me in the woods. My mind raced to every person i might have pissed off. To think who could be behind this. I knew whoever it was, to have this many people out here in the woods. They were serious. \"COME ON! COME AND DO IT THEN! I'VE GOT A FUCKING KNIFE\" I literally screamed into the dark woods. It was probably now about 2am. The shadows just kept darting between trees only now... they looked small. Not even my height (I'm not very tall). The moon had gone back behind the clouds. But then all of a sudden a bright white beam came down from the moon to the middle of the woods. My mind then, and I remember with clarity, thought \"i cannot believe this is an alien conspiracy, oh my God im going to be abducted, ill disappear and no one will ever know what happened \"..... it sounds ludicrous in hindsight. But the terror i felt in that moment. I pulled out the knife. Id rather fucking kill myself than be taken by aliens. The time now must have been about 4am because it literally started to grow lighter....i looked around in horror. The blade of the Stanley knife to my wrist. It was like my whole soul screamed \"NO!\" The light came fast. I looked around. There was no one. I was freezing. My eyes were literally bulging out of my skull. A moment of clarity came smashing through all the horror. I collapsed to my knees and looked at myself. I was covered in mud. Id actually cut into my arm and blood ran down my hand.. I was filthy. I sat there with my head in my hands crying for ages. What had my life become. I pulled myself up and walked home. All the way, paranoid thoughts rushed through my head. People in cars stared at me. Men in white vans were going to pull up and bundle me into their vans. The reality was it was about 5am. There were hardly any cars about. The bad tripped lingered. I had to force myself not to look at the shadow people. I remember one vividly leaning on the bonnet of a car cradling a baseball bat. I forced myself to look down and just get home. Now the reality that it was a bad trip, was a thought I could understand. I felt distraught. I got home. I got into bed. And i slept for two full days. I got up after that 48 hours, and I made a serious attempt to kill myself. My mum found me unconscious. I was in hospital for 3 days. I woke up, discharged myself. And you know what? Went and scored some more meth. If you are young, or any age. Don't do that shit. It is evil. It is the worst most horrible thing. It will make you do terrible things to people you love. It will make you do terrible things to yourself. It just is not worth it. Peace guys !",

A war that involves the spiritual heavenly hosts and principalities of darkness. I personally feel that this says so much in regards to the Christian faith. I feel that this says so much more than just going to church every Sunday and putting on a smile for our white suburban brothers at a midweek bible study. The bible is essentially saying there are beings that have existed, spiritually, in our world, or realm, for an uncounted number of lifetimes. The beings have seen nation rise and nation fall. These beings are the ultimate researchers on the human condition and can predict what you're going to do before you even decide that you will do it. Some of these creations have even sat at the foot of God's throne. I suppose where my issue is, is in my own life. I, like many Christians, battle against Sin and the world daily. I read the Bible. I try to represent Christ the best I can. I fail many times. I know there is much more going on in our world than just what we see with our eyes and speak with our mouths. But at times, I wonder if I will ever truly understand or partake in this supernatural battle that rages on. I'm a nurse at a hospital who helps people daily, sure, but its still just a job at times. I then proceed home and fiddle on my computer and maybe be with friends. It's a relatively monotonous life, that has been replicated one billion times over in many other countries and timelines. I guess my biggest question is: Can I expect to experience God on a supernatural level, the kind that changes lives, or is my meandering lifestyle going to hold me back from truly seeing what I know is out there until the day my soul leaves body?",

    "input_text": "Would you consider this book YA or New Adult (or even just Adult)? So the story's about a little girl from a screwed up family whose childhood friend commits suicide. Over the course of the book she goes from 7 to late twenties, although for the bulk of the book she's 9 to 23. It's first person from her perspective, and the prose is in the style of middle grade fiction. No drugs, no sex. Text Samples (age 9):\nHalfway through the fourth grade, Mrs. Schwaltz gave us a math assignment. Its going to be a little harder than what you are used to, she warned us, so you can find a partner and work together. I glanced over at Justin, since he had always been my partner for previous projects. Justin continued to watch the teacher. Once Mrs. Schwaltz gave the okay, the other students began partnering up. I stayed at my desk, my eyes fixated on the back of Justins head. Now hell have to talk to me, I thought to myself. Instead, Justin turned to the Kevin Vazquez. Hey Kevin, wanna be my partner? Sure, said Kevin Vazquez. I felt a slight twang of pain inside. Second text sample (main character in late twenties):\nMy aunt sighed. Why cant you just be happy with what you have, Emilia? Why do you have to search for shortcomings? I wondered why she expected me to turn out any differently. Just look how far youve come in the past six years, my aunt continued. Look how much you have grown as a person. I thought about it. I felt guilty. Why guilty? I think of Justin. He needed help like I did, only no one was there to help him. My aunt sighed. Justins suicide opened your mothers eyes. She realize that it was possible for a child to suffer depression and she needed to see things from your perspective. The term made me angry. He was twenty-three. How was he a child? Anyway, the reason I really need to know is because my current word count is fine for YA (58k), a bit low for New Adult, and too low for Adult. It's completely readable for both a teen and an adult.",

Or I imagine other drivers complaining about how slow I am or my erratic direction. The more usual thoughts are negative ones, about how wrong everything is, how badly I do things, all my mistakes and faults. My mind is always looking for reasons to feel bad and guilty. Whenever I do something, there is a voice in my head whispering: \"You are doing it wrong. YOU are wrong\". The worst ones are about raping little kids. I know I would never do that nor I'm attracted to that but just having those thoughts popping on your head automatically whenever you see a little kid, damn, it's scary. Luckily this kind of thoughts are not usual anymore. When I was a teenager I use to have rituals like touching things the same amount of times in the left and in the right. I was obsessed with simmetry. I could spin a jar to the left, then feel obligated to spin it to the right to balance things. Then again to the left, but in a minor angle, again to the right... and so on until the handle stayed in the center.

That girlfriend broke up with him, so he called me tonight to vent and just bounce ideas.

In a moment where I felt very alone, he unknowingly reminded me that I am not alone at all. Pick up the phone.

    "input_text": "Those who kill Part 2 I puked more when i lifted my hand from the remnants of my father's skull to attempt and get up. I wanted to cry, to scream, but I only felt searing, white wash anger. He looked at my expression and let out a loud laugh, short and high pitched. His parents watched beside him as i struggled with my grasp on reality. They were serial killers. They viciously murdered my parents, and now they are going to do the same to me. It was the mother this time who met my eyes, she came closer to me and leaned down until i could smell her rotten breath. Her evil eyes traced me, i snarled, and spat in her face. Her son roared and charged me on all fours like an animal. He put his mouth on my arm and took a bite of my flesh like it was cotton candy. My blood spluttered out, adding to the pool on the floor, and on his face. I grabbed my wound and kicked him and his mother square in the face. They fell back and knocked into the father who was already on the move to strike. I leaped up and ran past them, her gnarled fingers catching my ankle. I toppled down the flight of stairs, and managed to keep crawling until i could come to a stand. Somehow i was quicker than them and ran out of that god forsaken hell and onto the streets. This time i didnt scream for help I just ran. I had nowhere to go, no phone, no parents, and very little sanity left. I heard their footsteps behind me, catching up. All I needed to do was hit the main road and hopefully, they wouldnt be dumb enough to follow me. I was running on pure adrenaline, my mind and body was acting on pure survival instinct. Cars were passing by, and my heart jumped out of my chest before my arms flailed for help. Unfortunately the family was behind me,and they were close too. I ran out in front of the next car that was approaching and it shrieked to a halt. I could see the person in the car was absolutely terrified and I screamed that there were people chasing me, trying to kill me. By now they had caught up and the person in the car was so bewildered that she tried to drive away, but the son smashed himself through the windshield. I watched as they ganged up on the woman inside of the car, and beat her until her head collapsed onto the steering wheel. The car horn was sounding around me like a siren, and I turned and ran in the other direction as fast as I could. Was all i could think as my bare feet hit the concrete painfully in each step. I looked back and they had threw the womans dead body onto the road and commandeered her car. They were now heading straight towards me heading about fifty miles an hour. Another car was on coming the opposite direction and i just prayed to whatever god was out there that they saw what was happening. I flung myself out of the way as the family passed me, barely escaping death. They slammed the car into the other, flipping it twice. I stood watching in horror as the son turned to me a second before it happened and smiled that sadistic smile of his. Surely the person in the other car was dead from the impact of a head on collision. I didnt even bother to stick around and check to see if i was right. I had ran about 2 miles, and luckily I knew up ahead was a convenience store that would be littered with people and a phone. My arm and feet were soaking with blood, and my clothes the same. I looked like i had just been baptised in it. I checked behind my shoulder to see if they, by some chance of god were following me. They were nowhere to be seen. I hobbled into the bright lights of the gas station, my feet no longer covered by skin. The people who were standing by the gas pumps, mindlessly filling their tanks, gawked at me. I stared right back at them as I walked past and into the store. The guy behind the counter immediately noticed me and rushed around with a double barrel shotgun. I held up my hands in innocence and stammered that I just escaped kidnappers. That sounded better than I just ran two miles from fucking lunatic serial killers. The customers in the store had stopped what they were doing and were know watching the events unfold. The kind man who introduced himself as brian, called the police and let me wait in the breakroom while we waited. He bandaged up my arm and my feet in a combination of horror and disgust. You poor boy, I am so sorry. Did you recognize them? I nodded, and told them exactly who they were. He tied up the end of my bandage and sat back on his heels, searching my eyes with furrowed brows. Are you one hundred percent sure? Did he not believe me? Yes, I can describe the way their house looks, the inside, the pictures on the wall, anything. When the police get here I can take them to where the bodies are, and where they wrecked into another car on the way to kill me. He looked solemn, as if his mind had just shut down trying to process the information I just slammed on him. He rubbed the back of his neck in anxiety,\nThey always seemed like such nice people, I mean the son was a little wonky, but still. I narrowed my eyes,\nYou knew them? He nodded slowly,\nIt's a small town boy, everyone needs gas or a pack of cigarettes. Their son Andrew always came in and bought a pack of starbursts and a strawberry cream soda every sunday after church. I had to hold back broken laughter, they actually went to church? How the fuck did they not burst into flames upon walking into Gods territory. Those people had to be some sort of branch of satan's offspring. The police arrived, and I told the story once more. The sheriff appeared as if he was going to be sick. His thick black moustache wiggled as if it was trying to escape his face. The sheriff and brian met eyes. Alright, you feel comfortable with showing me where everything happened? I will also need to get an official report. I shook my head. I thanked brian for helping me, his face was decorated with timid worry as I trailed behind Sheriff Langston. Two miles in we saw the car that the family had shamelessly wrecked into, still smoking on the side of highway 24. There was no sign of them, but the car they had stolen was piled in the ditch. The front end was almost completely destroyed, the airbags were deflated, and the windshield was just, gone. There is no way they could have survived right? I asked nervously, praying he would say no. Langston looked over at me in disbelief. Kid, I really wanted to believe you made this up. My eyes widened, and I threw my hands at the scene in front of us. Now do you believe me? They killed my parents, and however many other people, and tried to kill me. Saying my parents were dead was the most horrid taste i have ever had on my tongue. I choked back a cry as I tore my face away from the sheriffs. He called for backup, and an ambulance as he surveyed the scene. They killed the lady who was driving this car. I said as i accompanied him, not really wanting to sit in his car alone. Her poor, helpless face was forever seared in my mind as i watched her die. I never should have tried to stop her, it was my fault she was dead. Shit, she probably had a husband and kids. Now those kids were without a mom, just like me. I was an orphan. I took Langston to where I assumed her body would be. We searched the road and followed a blood trail into the ditch on the left side of the road. Her body lay still, with her eyes wide open still in horror. She must have still been alive when they threw her out of the car, and tried to crawl away from the road. Somehow that made it even worse. Backup finally showed, along with the swat team and me and the sheriff got back in his car. The three minute drive felt like an hour, as I dreaded every second of anticipating seeing their faces once again. Theyre probably long gone by now. I muttered. He half shrugged. There will still be evidence all over the house, blood is hard to completely erase. There also should still be saliva from the son on your arm, if he is in our system thats proof enough for a warrant. I sighed, and stared ahead as we pulled onto my street. Except it was no longer my street, no longer my home, but a horrible reminder that I was completely alone. Langston reeved it, and raced into their yard, followed by the swat and a few other cop cars. The swat hopped out of their van and ran into the house like a stampede of bulls after a matador. I want you to stay here. Langston said firmly, his hand on his gun. No, I want to see them die. I whispered, not really to him, but to myself. He pointed his eyes at me, and his lips grew tight. Somehow I felt like he understood that. Before he could say anything else, there was a loud explosion inside the house. We both immediately looked up to see flames erupting from the windows where the glass was blown out completely. Son of a fucking bitch. Langston cursed and jumped out, as he was running up to the house, one of the swat men crawled out of the house. His protective gear was all but gone, and he struggled to take off his helmet as Langston approached him. I got out of the car and joined Langstons side, as we knelt by the man. A few other cops had arrived at this point, and the other cops were gathering around. The neighbours were coming out of their houses and onto the street to rubberneck on the scene. What happened? Langston asked in grave concern. The mans face was sweltered up from the blast, he was wheezing, and gasping for air. Langston looked back at the other policeman and nodded towards the back of the house. They drew their guns and quickly went to scope out the rest of the scene. It was just us and the man now. Theyre all dead, everyone of them. He wheezed, tears welling up. Lanston called another ambulance and the fire team to the address over his radio in a violently calm voice. I looked at his face, he was scared. It was horrifying seeing a grown man- a grown police officer so terrified. The smoke from the house was billowing up to the sky now, like some sort of signal from god to stop this nightmare. I was too focused on the sky, to realize that the man had took his final breath. Langston closed his eyelids in respect, and stood to his feet. He looked at me with the most peculiar look in his eyes, and said,\nI want to see them die too. Upon hearing his words, something inside of me snapped. It may have been the little sanity I had left, or the pieces of humanity that my parents and the world taught me. Either way, both were gone. The officers returned from their perimeter search, and brought a note to the sheriff. The officer who handed langston the note, almost couldnt even hold it,because his hands were trembling so hard. I stood beside him, and we read it,\nHelp me, help me, is what you all will be saying.",

Insecurities are getting to me and I don't know what to do anymore Back story:My (F26) partner (M26) of 8+ years , we haven't had the perfect relationship. We started dating the beginning year of Sr. Year in high school. We were friends before getting into this relationship. Soit started ok but got really rocky after a couple of years. I myself have never been a sexual person because trauma as a child. I've gone to therapy and have improved but still little no desire to have any sexual activity. The thing is that my partner has always has a high libido and me well I don't. So it ends up with us fighting because of this I get it the man has needs.

    "input_text": "Getting my ADHD diagnosis and meds was the best thing that ever happened to me. I've had depression several times and always been anxious and felt like I was not dumb, but that I was dumb if that makes sense? I've had toxic relationships because I never felt good enough due to me being ex bad at listening at times, distracted, \"lazy\" with house work and just extremely self conscious, which made me feel like everything I did was wrong. I've had a hard time following through on projects, could not focus in school or do homework, even tho I was bright enough and had a lot of sexual issues as well. Last summer/fall I got a major depression. The worst I ever had. I never took medication for my depressions, as a friend of mine took bad antidepressants and got all fucked, so that scared me. But this time I was SO miserable, that I just wanted it to be fixed and after struggling with our mental healthcare system (I live in Denmark) for months and being send around to new psychiatrists who needed to interview me for 1-2 hours from scratch each time and then decide I was not their field, I finally got to an amazing psychiatrist. I asked all the others, if I could possibly be diagnosed with ADHD, but they all specialized in depression and send me around. I did not even ask my psychiatrist about it, she just said that I might have ADHD and we needed to look into that and then I got my diagnosis and started drugs. The drugs changed my life. One brand made me extremely nauseous, but the ones I have now only have a few side effects (I do not have a lot of appetite and used to be eating and snacking ALL THE TIME, so this thing with eating when not hungry and remembering to eat is a bit of a challenge, but it is working out now). But I do have a much easier time focusing. Both on smaller tasks at hand, like reading an e-mail or making coffee without burning myself, but also on organizing my stuff, cleaning and my job. I also feel calmer and fresher at the same time, which make social events and being around my partner much easier and I feel more connected to my body and more present, which makes it easier for me to be the person I want to be. Both in terms of job and social/romantic realtionships. I also sleep better and are much less anxious. I still have a bit of ADHD symptoms of course, but I fell much less embarrassed and in control of myself and my diagnosis have also learned me to cope with it mentally. To give myself permission to be different and not aim to do everything perfect all the time. I am working on the stuff, I want to change (like talking a lot), but also accepting that it is a part of me and that I have to live with that I don't use my diagnosis as an excuse, but as a reason. I'm not perfect and that is okay. I try my best and don't always succeed, but I do try my best, and that is the best I can do. I also try to explain, what I am experiencing to my friends, partner and family, so they can understand better, that when I ex talk for one hour about something completely boring and they tell me something important and I don't listen, it is not because I feel more important than them or do not have any interest in them they just need to tell me; \"Now I want to say something important\" and I'll focus on listening. And I am aware, that this is something I do and I work to change it, but beating myself up about it all the time, even tho I hate it, just gives me anxiety and makes it even harder to control myself. I also feel much less overwhelmed/fussy/like my head is melting after having to focus or meet people. I sleep better at night. I feel better about myself and have more energy to change or do stuff in my life, to make it better applying for a challenging, but interesting job or just organising my clothes, so it is easier to find what I need. And I am in a healthy relationship, where I am not being a childish bitch or being exploited or dependent. I just feel happy, calm and WORTHY. I've never felt worthy before and I have dated TRASH, that was definitely less worthy than I... I would like to end by saying, that my meds stopped working hours ago, as I had an early morning and here it is now late night. So while writing this I am both tired and my ADHD is full-blown active, which might be why I wrote so much and almost don't remember what I wrote. Sorry about that. But yeah, the diagnosis and the meds DEFINATELY changed my life for the better. And I've only been taking them for half a year, but that half year has been the best ever.

The feeling that even doing a simple task such as picking a sock up from the floor or having a shower is like climbing a mountain. I can feel exhausted after getting ready for work in the morning. Depression can make it difficult to enjoy life and isolates you. You do seem to be going down a route of isolation if you are thinking about leaving school - but maybe the early stages. I was as you describe when I was younger. I hated school and didn't understand why I was there, I still think that schools are really just big nurseries where society puts children so that they don't cause trouble! They are not places of great education in my opinion, they are places that frequently create sheep as fodder for society. It could be the initial start of depression, I think that racing thoughts are common but they may be more linked to anxiety than depression. The smoking may be your attempt to self medicate. In the long run you may want to educate yourself on the effects of THC when not combined with CBD. It is common for skunk to have 12-15% of THC content but very little CBD. CBD is the cannabinoid that protects against mental health issues. My best advice is to talk to a counsellor or psychologist but make up your own mind as to whether to follow their advice. They often don't seem to be much use either other than for emptying your wallet - but I am maybe a little cynical as others seem to have had great success with them. Don't be afraid to change counsellors if you do go to one, find one that suits you and that you can relate to. If you have good parents then maybe you can chat with them and let them know what you are thinking and feeling. They may be able to help with support and advice. I may be scary to approach them but good parent will want to try to help. Good luck.",

Sometimes it isn't central to the plot like that. It's always there, though. Also, to be perfectly honest, I've always wanted to be a great writer. It's just taken me 25 years to become comfortable with trying. So that constantly keeps me motivated to keep publishing stories and writing about new topics. Finally, I *love* horror. I grew up on it. Think what you will, but my mom introduced me to horror movies when I was still a single-digit age. It didn't scar me. Well, I do have some *irrational fears* from some things (ha, get it /u/IrrationalFearsHost?! I said your podcast name), but nothing that's negatively impacted my life. Instead, I fell in love. I love being scared or disturbed. I love not being able to sleep at night. I want to do for other people what all of those great horror directors amd writers did for me.

It didn't help that my sister was absolutely gorgeous in her teens while I was a kid. She also got our moms complexion while I got our dads, so I am white and she looks more ethnic. As a kid I knew I wasn't very pretty and didn't care but not looking like my mom and sister bothered me. People loved to point out how white I am, others would ask if I was adopted. I hated it. Once I was in 7th and 8th grade I started to care more about my looks. Which was basically the same time they were beginning to improve as I was starting to bloom into the woman I am today. During that time I also was developing an eating disorders due to stress of moving and whatnot as well as the fact that I am just prone to mental disorders. I had started cutting myself a couple years before that. But my anorexia lasted a while. The kicker is that while I started getting skinny and pretty (not that I was overweight before) my sister got pregnant and gained 50 pounds in her pregnancy. She has struggled with her weight off and on since. Nothing extreme, she's has definitely never been plus sized. It was weird though that as the age gap between us became less significant I sort of also caught up with her appearance wise. Still white though. For the record I no longer struggle with an eating disorder or self harm. Still crazy though.",

    "input_text": "So I thought I ate a spider in my sleep... I remembered that half-awake moment of confusion very vividly. I groaned, blinked, and moved my mouth around as I blearily stared up at the dark ceiling. There was some sort of weird hair or something on my lip pulling at it, I felt a subtle slippery tug in my throat, and it took another three seconds to slide the whole thread out. Disgusted and confused, I held it up to the sliver of moonlight coming in the window. What the hell was this thing? Some unknown girl's hair? No - it was wispier than that, more reflective, and a little stickier\nI felt suddenly queasy as the thought occurred to me that this was probably a silken spider thread. Had I just eaten a spider in my sleep? Jesus christ! I got up that night, refusing to go back to sleep, but the day's light dispelled my silly fears. If I *had* eaten a spider, it was long dead by now thanks to the stomach acid generously donated by my night-long anxiety. A few weeks passed, and I mostly forgot about the incident. I noticed that, very slowly, I began having trouble exercising at my usual rate. I was sleeping worse, and groggy even when I did sleep. I thought that it might just be the season, or allergies, and I tried to ignore it until I fell asleep at work, and my boss sternly told me to go the doctor. I was never one for the doctor, but I was tired of being tired, so I finally manned up and went. I sat in the stark white office waiting for quite some time. I figured the doctor probably wouldn't have any answers for me - they never seemed to care enough to pursue individual mysteries - but I *was* hoping for a prescription or something. I sat still as the nurse did all the usual tests - blood pressure, pulse, and so on. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She left, and I waited some more. Finally, the doctor walked in, and greeted me without looking. She asked about my symptoms, nodded a bit, and then used a stethoscope to listen to my chest. That's when she frowned. \" It might be allergies, or even asthma. Sounds a bit scratchy in there.\" \"That's what I thought,\" I told her. \" I've been wracking my brain. Hell, for awhile, I even thought it was a spider I ate.\" She glanced up at me, making eye contact for the first time. \" You ate a spider?\" \"In my sleep, I think.\" She hesitated. \" There's this new spider infestation. African, I think. We've had a couple bad reactions to bites. Total longshot here, but if it bit your esophagus or stomach, you wouldn't feel it, but you could still have a reaction. Let's get a soft tissue scan done.\" Confused and worried, but hopeful, I followed her advice and went to the next building over in the complex for the scan. The hour queue allowed me to fill out every form and exhaust every magazine in the small waiting room before they finally called me up. I followed the attendant warily into the imaging room. I'd seen it on television, sure, but the experience was far more intense than it looked. I had to lie still for quite some time, fighting all sorts of sudden urges to itch, sneeze, or cough while I waited. By the time it was over, I felt a built-up coughing fit coming on. The smiling attendant came in, told me I did a great job, and started checking things. Alright, I sighed. It was over. Time to get up and get out of here -\nAnother attendant peeked in the door. A doctor stood behind him. They both motioned for their colleague, and I found myself momentarily alone. I sat up, watching them confer in hushed tones just outside. The three approached me. \" We're going to need you to come with us real quick. It's not an emergency, we just need to speak to you in private.\" Feeling hot from my approaching coughing fit, I followed them to a small room, where they directed me to sit and handed me a biohazard waste bin. \"I want you to close your eyes and cough into this trashcan, alright son?\" the doctor told me, his tone quavering. \" And whatever you do, keep your eyes closed. It's important that you don't look, for, um - radiological reasons - from the imaging machine.\" \"Yeah, the machine,\" an attendant echoed, gulping. Their masked fear had my pulse racing, but I was more than ready to start coughing to ease the pain in my throat. Leaning over the waste bin, I began a heavy, hacking cough, letting out endless choking breaths that seemed filled with weird dust and particulates. Had I accidentally breathed in something radioactive from the machine? I kept coughing. I tasted a little blood. I breathed in and out. They urged me to keep coughing, their voices shaking and subtly disgusted. \"Come on, just a little more, son,\" the doctor told me. His practiced hands trembled on my shoulder. The last cough seemed to spasm my whole body, and I felt clotted particulates rise up my throat and finally escape. Spitting and pushing more air out through my mouth, I got the last of it out of me. Feeling much better, I made the mistake of relaxing - and opening my eyes. The doctor saw me staring down, and gripped my shoulders tight. \" Don't panic. You're safe now. It's just that - we saw the note about a spider you ate, and we did look at your stomach, but your stomach was fine. It was well, they're attracted to moving air, see and it had made webs, and laid eggs thousands of eggs in your lungs.\" In shock, I nodded, unable to do anything but stare at the three-inch-thick pile of baby spiders roiling around in the bottom of the waste bin.",

    "input_text": "Vyvanse 50mg was the first medication I ever tried. It remains my favorite. It allows for smooth focusing, a pleasant amount of energy, and has a pretty steady release throughout the day. I took it for six months and found that it remained effective throughout that time and I only built up a mild tolerance to it. Unfortunately, when I switched my insurance policy, it became too expensive. Concerta was the next option. I was on 18mg per day. I do not like Concerta and would not personally recommend it, but ADHD manifests differently in everyone, and subsequently, so do its medications. I like to explain my experience with Concerta by saying that Vyvanse allowed me to pleasantly focus on one or two tasks at a given time, whereas Concerta made me feel like I needed to focus on a dozen tasks at a given time. Its release throughout the day had too harsh of a peak-and-trough effect. I have comorbid hypersomnia in addition to my ADHD, and so I also rely on stimulants to keep me awake. I was on it for two months and found that when it wasn't working, I was dead tired. When it was working, I felt nearly manic. Adderall XR 20mg was the next attempt. It worked pretty well, but because of my aforementioned hypersomnia, I found that once I came down around 6-7 hours after taking it, I would abruptly burn out for the day. I was on this for only one month. Aaaand finally, I'm currently on Adderall IR (immediate release) 20mg, twice a day. This seems to work pretty well for me. I take one when I wake up around 9 AM, and another around 2 PM. I still prefer Vyvanse, only because Adderall has a harsher comedown for me. I find that at the end of the day, I become very irritable. I describe it to my boyfriend as a kind of \"sensory overload\" feeling where I need very little stimulation, or else I'll become agitated. But it does help me to focus on a couple of major tasks at a time without feeling too overwhelmed, and it gives a nice boost of energy that I need to get out of bed in the morning and make it through class.",

    "input_text": "I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll just go down through the order you went in, and elaborate on things as I go. Although I was already sort of interested, I was 12 when I formally began studying this stuff independently, so around the same age. I can't speak to your experience with the mirror specifically, as I know nothing about that other than my dad told me that if you stare into the mirror long enough you will see who you were in a past life. I too have some really vague early memories, like the taking of my first portraits (as a baby). One's vision is not fully developed at that point; all I know from the memory is that it was done by what I can determine was an old lady (although I certainly didn't know the meaning or vocabulary to interpret that at the time). I'm so sorry to hear about your childhood trauma. Becoming empowered, if you will, had the opposite effect on me. It's like I became a new person. I had suffered from some anxiety issues in childhood, and, at that point, I learned to overcome them, with mental fortitude, and it's like my childhood before that was sealed off like a past life. I remember major things and the general format of regular occurrences, like going to the mall with my mom, but not a lot of specific mundane memories. Those are somehow locked away. Dreams with premonitions are a perfectly normal part of life; some people just have them a lot more than others, if you are receptive to it, and if you sleep well enough to remember it. Lately I haven't been sleeping well, but when I do, I remember my dreams every night, and have *psychic* ones at least once a week. My most recent one predicted that I would have to go to the store with my mom to return a pack of socks. But in the dream they were white socks; the real ones, the next day, were black socks. So yes, of course, the signals you are subconsciously picking up on are never exact, because although, theoretically, the signal your mind is receiving and reading ought to be exact, it must pass though our mind and perceptual set (our lens of understanding), and be interpreted into language. And I am totally familiar with the \"THIS IS IT\" moment. I wouldn't describe it in quite the same way, but it feels great. I am quite good at getting a feel for people's intentions/emotions, and I can complete sentences and such for people. I don't have a deep empathic link like you described though; that is intense. I have no connection to Buddhism, but meditating to channel energy is basically the first thing I learned how to do in this field. As you surely already know, but may or may not have realized, the first thing one must be able to do is clear one's mind; think of absolutely nothing. In my mind's eye, my energy is electric blue and sparkly. My favorite color tbh. I guess it resonates with me. so greenish yellow (which is one of the colors that only a percentage of the population can see, thanks to having extra cones in the cornea) is evidently a color which resonate with you. It's really cool that you met someone like Dakota. I wish I had. I taught some people some skills; my dad is into this stuff but I never could really talk to him about these things in more than a theoretical sense. the director for a theater play I was in once, after I had read someone's mind and freaked them out because they somehow knew (I didn't do it as a parlor trick, I did it to guess a number to get a part in the intro scene we were adding), so she, the director, calmly talked about aborigine mental communication until he calmed down (like two minutes). Enchanting objects is quite easy to do. As with any \"spell\", if you will, it is all about channeling energy for intentions; simple as that. One of the persons I was teaching was my ex, before we got together. I'd taught him to do make a shield (like you described sealing the room sort of), and I could feel him extend it around me as he practiced it. I didnt say anything, because, as we were just friends at the time, I didn't know how to react to such a personal trust; because that's almost like giving someone access to your soul; like, I'm protecting myself from any potential negative influences, but I feel no need to protect my mind and my soul from you. I didnt say anything, but then he asked if I knew what he did, and I let him tell me before I said I knew, because, at the back of my mind, I didnt want to be wrong. I hadn't been teaching him long when he enchanted an object, a hairbow, and gave it to me. I didn't have to ask though; I knew exactly what he did. It was a love spell. The \"legal\" kind; the reminder/make you think of me kind. I knew and I wore it anyways because it was sweet. I told him \"I know what you did to this\", and he just smiled. your friend's ability to visibly see the energy and not just sense it is very special. I had one friend who could visibly see auras (I think, or she could feel the color; one or the other). I have yet to visibly see such things, but I can feel them, and visualize them in my mind's eye. so, on that note, could Dakota see the color of the energy? or just sense it? People are socialized to not believe though. I had an ex friend who I had started teaching, whom me enemies turned against me (yes mind control spells are a thing; she was the first I taught, and from then on, I learned to teach defense first, as I was describing about my ex). Even if they've witnessed things, like how Dakota accurately described what you did, they can be convinced it wasn't real. So watch out for that. Do you still speak to Dakota? Earth is my element; there's a story about how I know that as 100% fact (but I dont like dirt?, so it's strange). I am quite impatient. I have done \"work\" that involved a meditative state for more than 20 minutes, but to just focus energy for 20 minutes solid? That I've never done. I would like to though. who knows what I could accomplish. That being said; to make anything big happen, it is a fact I have found, and that a powerful wiccan I know (who I didn't find out was a wiccan until later) also happened to say, is that: *you have to need it* . One of the biggest things I've ever done, I did without waiting for a buildup of energy, because the energy came from the sheer force of dire need. ( I can share that story too if you want). The need however, lies with the person. What is a dire need for you may not be a dire need for others. If you can make yourself feel a dire need, then the power is yours. That is hard to fake though. I am still working on it (though not as much as I'd like to). Energy manipulation has a young prime. Once life responsibilities take over your mental energy, it is hard to do, unless you've kept it up continuously. The biggest tip I can give you, especially to get the dreams back, is to get adequate sleep. I have been staying up late lately, because I am studying abroad and have major FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) with my night owl friends. But prior to that, I had been getting more sleep and thus, having more lucid and *psychic* dreams. That last experience you mentioned though, specifically, I don't think that's earth energy. That's electric, or weather. Just pure energy really. That's what lightning and thunder are. Electricity. Sheer force. A force of nature. :) So yeah; I could probably go on and on, but I hope this is helpful/ comforting, and feel free to AMA.",

    "input_text": "Continuing the saga of my(f34) husband(m32) not loving me. More confused than angry right now. ( Links to previous posts in text). Original post: <URL>\nFirst update: <URL>\nSecond update: <URL>\nOk. It has now been three and a half weeks since he intially told me that he no longer loved me. We have talked and talked, but I am becoming more and more confused by his attitude toward me, the kids, the future. He is swinging between being very open emotionally, talking things through in great detail, what he feels about us moving back to the UK. Then the next day, he is grumpy, ignoring me, neglecting his time with the kids, flaking out on plans to do things with the kids. One day he cannot do enough to help out, the next I am having to ask him to come and say goodnight to the kids because he can't be bothered to come upstairs. He dedecates most of his time to playing on his PC and working out. Just saying that makes me realize that he is still such an adolescent. I don't think he has ever lost the mentality that he is his own person and he can do whatever he likes. Yes, that was true, but I believe that when you have children, you have to have a balance in your life towards what you give to your family, and what you give to yourself. He told me the other day, when he was in a bad mood, that he feels that he has to support me too much (an example was having to come and get me when my car broke down) and because of my health problems he feels he has to look after me too much. He told me that I was living my life like I was in the 1950's and that men aren't expected to look after women like that anymore. He seems to have neglected the fact that I work full time, look after the kids for 75% of the time on my own, he goes out at least twice a week for social stuff, and that tomorrow I am having to run him around because his car broke down! Yes I do have health issues, but I have had them since we met, and they are actually much better now than when we first got married! I had to apologise to him earlier this week, because tomorrow I need him to miss his games session after work because I have therapy and I cannot get anyone else to have the kids (it is around dinner time, so kind of hard to arrange pick up and drop off). I feel that I should not be having to apologize for going to a session that was the only one left this week when I booked it two weeks ago. I asked my therapist to reshedule, but her calendar is full and she really wanted to see me this week. He has know about the appt since I made it, but at no point did he offer to come home to have the kids. He keeps asking me to stay. But not as a couple, as two people living in the same house who have kids together, but no relationship. He keeps telling me how much better it would be for me and the kids to stay. He says I could save up money from my job before moving back, the kids wouldn't have to move etc. And the more he says it, the more I feel like I am the bad guy here, taking the kids away from everything they know and love. Yes, I could do that. But is it worth the pain? I keep feeling so confused about what is the right thing to do. But how can I stay? If I could be sure that everything would be ok and stable for the kids, then I would. But on days like today, I can see that this is not a healthy environment for me or the kids. I am starting to feel that he is manipulating me to make me stay. To make me feel guilty for hurting the kids by moving. To get rid of his guilt over the choices he has made. To make me the bad guy making the descisions. I really feel he is forcing my hand here. And it is really starting to affect my ability to judge things properly. I no longer am sure that I can make the best decision for the kids. What if I am making the wrong choice and ruining my kids lives because of this? My friend was over today and saw for herself how he can make me feel bad for wanting something for me and the kids. I asked him if he had arranged a lift for the morning (he is prone to forget stuff like that) and he told me no, he would take my car 'if that was ok' and just do a half day to get home. I told him that I had plans for the morning with the kids, and he told me that he 'only needs it for half a day' . He just had no concept that he would be making me and the kids stay home when I had promised to take them out. I told him I would drive him in and out, and then he started demanding to know what time I would pick him up as he 'had to look after the kids for me'. My friend, who knows the situation, was just shocked to see first hand how he has no idea about how his actions affect others. He says that a lot. That he is doing stuff 'for me'. Not doing it because he is their dad, but as a favour. So that I owe him. **TL;DR** Am I being guilt tripped into staying by a man who tells me he doesn't love me? **edit** I meant to add that because I saw my OBGYN last week and told her the situation, she ran a full STD panel on me, just in case. Everything came back negative, so I have that going for me, which is nice.",

    "input_text": "Anger is natural in some forms of depression, unfortunately. I call them 'rage-flashes' when they happen to me. Something sets me off, sometimes something as simple as an imagined sleight in my mind, and I just want to lash out. It's unfortunate when we do lash out, because then we end up hurting ourselves, or worse, the people who care about us. Sounds to me like you and your grandfather were close? Because it sounds to me like his passing had a dramatic effect on you - which death, especially the death of a family member, can and will effect you. Especially if that person is close. I recently lost my aunt to pancreatic cancer - about 3 months passed between her diagnosis and her death. It was quick, it was vicious - and it was painful. When I found out she passed, I cried. I cried hard. Her and I hadn't been that close in the past few years (mainly because of distance, living in a different state), but I remember going to her place a few times every summer when I was little. So, when she passed, all those good memories flooded my mind, and I fell apart. I got depressed. I spiraled out, and just got angry for a short time at the universe - because how could it be so cruel as to take her from my family so quickly, and with such little warning. It's painful, there's nothing you can do about it. But that pain reminds us that we're human. Being human makes us special - regardless of whatever you may think or hear - being human does make you special. And being special makes you worth it. As for you happiness, when you're dealing with so much, it can be hard to find. But it can be found. Start taking steps to get help with your depression. See a doctor, talk to friends who you can trust to seriously listen, and if none of those really appeal, come back to /r/depression, and voice your thoughts and feelings. Because, again - you're worth it. You really, really, really are.",

    "input_text": "My one year free of weed It's been a crazy ride for sure. I just want to share some of my story and experiences. Maybe some one else went through some of the same things as I did. Maybe you're going through it now. I started smoking weed at 16, I was a musician so it felt natural. I preferred cigarettes and alcohol, so I never got too sucked in. I crushed on most of the guys I smoked with, they made me feel a false sense of validation. I stopped briefly, and by the time I got to college, I fell in love with mary jane again. Or at least the people passing me the blunt. One day a friend told me, \"Hey man, you know you need to buy a sack at some point, right?\" It hit me like a light from heaven; holy shit, I can buy weed. Again, and again, and again. I couldn't afford college after another year, being out of state, and too depressed to work, so I left. Shit got worse. I smoked all day, every day. Medical grade, all the time. I went in and out of programs and rehabs, mostly because I liked the alcohol, weed, pill combos. Years went by. I was moving at a snail's pace. I ended up moving on a whim to another state, and ended up in a shitty relationship in a shitty apartment. Fuck, the weed there wasn't even that great. But I put my game face on, and bought frequently from H dealers. Never any hard stuff. I had an epiphany after I had some money stolen. I invited a bunch of friends over (fitting). We popped pills. And I cried. I cried because I lost not only my money, but because I lost myself. I called 911 on myself, went to a hospital, and left after 3 days. 23, in the middle of a new state, and trying to stay sober, was insane. I couldn't sleep most nights. I stopped drinking caffeine. I was desperate for friends. My boyfriend and I fought constantly. But I kept my goal in mind, just fucking stay sober. I had the insight to leave the state, and plan my next move. I found a town I liked, with a career program I liked, and moved on in. Still fresh in my absence from weed, I was still overly talkative and couldn't find enough ways to spend my time. Unemployed. I made friends were I could, kept looking for a job, and prayed. I prayed all the time. Sometimes with other people, mostly by myself. Some people find it weird for an LGBT man to be spiritual, but fuck, that's all I had going. My family slowly starting respecting me again. I got phone calls from people that cared. I was moving forward, and people took notice. Finally, after all the job searching, I got a job I loved. Soon, a new car. Soon after that, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend, and I was dating normal people again. Things still affect me, but I have the emotional willpower to handle them like an adult. Life isn't so much a roller coaster, more so a stroll over the sand dunes at a beach. Every moment more beautiful than the last, even if I can't see the ocean from my point of view. I can't really dish out advice. I don't feel like that's my place. I can just share what I've gone through, and it was hell. I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy, even if that happens to be me. Life today is beautiful. And i'm glad to be hear to share it with you.",

It's soaring. It's flying. Arms spread wide, eyes closed, you don't lookbecause you don't need to see. On my back in a roaring cocoon of air, all emotions suspended in a timeless moment of pure calm and regret and nostalgia and love and determination, I fell in the same position in which we had first found Cristina on the cross. Once, as a child, I'd floated down a river on my back with arms spread; I'd hoped to be taken to places new and unknown to escape my life, and now that wish was being granted. The rushing veil of wind lifted my unkempt hair away from my face and I opened my eyes. I've been losing touch with my childhood pains for quite some time, and thus I find myself standing in a quiet poster-lined hallway rather than in the movie theater itself. The carpet is that old faded red I remember so well, for I was far closer to the ground back then. At some point in my life, I stopped really looking at carpet patterns and sidewalk grasses and roots in the path ahead. Now, nearing my end, I wish I'd kept up the habit. There is *so much beauty* in every single fractal detail of existence; enough to make ignoring even the slightest natural artwork a tragedy. But I came here for a reason. The theater is empty save for a haunting shadow that lurks in the corner watching me, so I angle past the concessions stand and out the front doors. The glass showed only white light, but I emerge onto a beach the color of dancing fire. Red and orange sand angles down beneath my boots toward a vivid blue ocean under a strikingly clear sky. On the horizon to my left I sight a high stone wall like that of an ancient city; just behind me, a tilted stone head twice the height of a person sits gazing unblinking across the sea. I take in all of this on the first look around. The second reveals the object of my search to me. He is sitting in the fiery sand directly ahead, arms around his knees. Like the weathered stone face, he, too, watches the bright ocean horizon. \" He stands suddenly, and I feel some measure of relief at seeing his kind smile and crooked nose again. He approaches across the sand from a distance, but somehow immediately steps close. \" How on Earth are you here?\" \"There's not much time,\" I tell him, my relief turning to cold iron. \" I'm falling. I need to understand what these realms are, what Death is, and how to stop it. You told me during the Time of Sickness, when I nearly drowned in a well, that you had met Death. Can you take me to it?\" \"Falling?\" he asks, concerned. I reiterate, \"Falling.\" For a brief moment, the sensations of life bleed through the curtain of perception. He gives a compassionate frown. \" I'm sorry.\" \"It won't matter if I'm successful. Time is short.\" He looks around, noticing the growing rapidity of our environment. Blue waves subtly roll in faster, the wind picks up speed, and my heart races in my imagined chest. All these things move in rhythm, increasing. For some reason, this perturbs him, but he still seems willing. \" He grabs my wrist and begins running toward the distant city wall. I go with him, acutely aware of the unheard sounds of a metaphorical clock made real ticking relentlessly faster and faster as I fall; as I run. He shouts, \"Open the gates!\"and a massive ingress reveals itself as two enormous slabs of bronze slide apart. Crowds of blurry-faced denizens watch us pass with awe. I stare briefly at their obscured expressions, trying to understand how I know what they're feeling, but all I can make out are primarily brown clothes heavy with strips and patches of bright reds, yellows, and blues. One waves, but how would I recognize him even if I knew him? Staring as we run past, I ask, \"What is this place?\" \"The unnamed city,\" he responds, pulling me along twisted alleyways made of tan stone. \" We can't linger here.\" Gazing up at gold and bronze trimmings along the edges of flat roofs speeding by, I ask, \"The Unnamed City?\" Not capitalized like that, since that would be a name.\" He looks left down one passage, then right along another. \" This unnamed city has infinite variants that coexist all at the same time. It is a place of urban dreams, and matches the layout of wherever you live for a short timebut if you stop moving anywhere but the gates or the docks, it'll change, and you'll get lost forever.\" Indeed, the crowd around us begins running at great speeds, pushing us along like a jubilant and cheerful river of greetings and recognitions. Blurry hands point at me from windows and doors and balconies while countless distorted voices shout eagerly to one another about the newcomer in their midst. \"Have you been here before?\" Heath asks as he turns sharply for a set of hewn tan stairs. We run up and out of the dense flow; as I step thankfully onto a clear and flat roof, I respond, \"No, have you?\" After leaping to the next roof, he says, \"Yes... in another life.\" Jumping from roof to roof, I shout over the growing wind, \"You've said that before. What do you mean?\" \"If I knew, I would tell you!\" he yells back. \" I've been places I shouldn't, seen things I wasn't supposed to know! I didn't go beyond the veil of Death like everyone elsebecause it thirsted for knowledge, and because it needed a willing and living human being to get here, a shadow of the primal essence of Hunger took me to these Dream Tessellations instead.\" A shadow? Looking back over my shoulder, I see the watcher following us still. \" Is that it? Is that the thing that brought you here?\" My hungry friend got caught in a dodekeract; it was too literal-minded, and couldn't experience metaphorical existence and navigate surreality the way we can. It couldn't *dream.* The entity back there is something else, and has been following you as long as I've known you.\" Ominous isn't a strong enough word. I realize that, even here, I am still at war. Surging ahead, I lend Heath some of my swiftness, and we speed over rooftops now blurring because of us rather than some natural property of the locale. The docks curve toward us along the slope of the world, and we leap down worn tan-brick stairs to reach the boats below. \"This is the hub of the Dream Tessellations,\" he explains, breathing hard. \" These boats can sail out onto the ocean and go anywhere you can imagine.\" Unfazed by the run thanks to the million hearts burning with mine, I ask, \"Will this path take me to Death, or just an imagined version of him?\" Heath shrugs. \" What's real in the back alleys of existence? What's real outside your own perceptions?\" That isn't good enough. \" Did you imagine meeting your Death?\" Still recovering, he looks down for a moment. \" No, I don't think so. It was definitely him.\" Looking back up at me, he says, \"But that doesn't mean yours will be anything like mine. If it happens, it'll be a very personal experience open to lifetimes of interpretation and understandingand every culture has their own version of Death.\" I don't quite understand, but I am not going to back down now. There can be no compromise. \" No time for a boat. The horizon you say?\" He nods, and then points out across placid blue. \" For what you seek, that way.\" After seeing me take a step forward, he adds, \"Be careful. You can lose yourself in these realms. There are a million reflections of you out therethe people you could have been, the people you were, and the people you might beand not all of them are good people. Find the Truth, and you'll find your purpose. \"Thank you.\" I give my strange friend a deep nod. \"Before you go,\" he says quickly. \" Will you tell Cristina and Noah I'm alright?\" That stops me in my tracks despite the trembling clock in my mind brimming with nervous energy. \" You know them?\" \"We never met in person, but if not for them, I would have been trapped forever, and I just\" He cuts himself off and wipes a tear from under one eye. \" Maybe they'll tell you about it sometime.\" Despite the strangeness of my location and surroundings, I lower my guard to give him a hug. \" I will tell them. Thank you for your guidance.\" He nods. \" It's who I am to help you, just like it's who you are to do what you're about to do. Last time we met, I remembered some of my life from about eight centuries ago and I tried to warn you about waking Conradbut that was not my role, just like it's not my role to advise against your duel with Death.\" He sighs. \" Stay by Cristina's side, will you? She'll need your support to stay the course. All of existence is at stake. I just don't know how yet. Does any of this make sense?\" A genuine laugh escapes my throat, and, for a moment, I forget my overwhelming rush. In the formal, I tell him, \"No. Not in the slightest, friend.\" \"You're a nice person,\" he murmurs, understanding me despite my shift in language. \" I've missed having someone living around to talk to. If you'd been here, maybe I could have made sense of the strange things I've learned in my eons spent wandering the Tessellations. Please remember these words, for giving you this may be the last real thing I do: the Lovers circle opposite around a vast whirlpool of warm red water; they seek each other, but neither can see the other, save for a single message in a bottle that bobs hopefully in the heat. The Ruthless Parent, denied her child, cracks an orb of gold and spills hatred and bitterness into a massive white whirlpool of light. And the Survivor walks across his prison cell in a single step, but it takes all eternity; he arrives enlightened, but a black whirlpool awaits to steal away everything he ever knew.\" The shadow lurking around the corner behind us stares; I try to memorize every word. \" What's it mean?\" He shakes his head. \" I don't know exactly. I saw these images when I sought the Truth. My Death, before he faded away, warned me that the fury of Life's conflict will escalate until all of existence is in danger. I fear we may be in the final cycle of Time, and I think Cristina will need your help to avoid being part of the problem.\" I think of her kindness and motherly warmth; I think of the fires of war that burn inside her, and I think of her coldly militant heart. She did not order the attack on the Enemy to be halted as she'd promised me in private, but she'd certainly secured the list of Finders to seek out her lost family members. I sense deep pain in her, and that ruthlessness to protect the ones I love also exists in me, so\"I understand.\" He flashes a sad smile. \" The ticking clock surges back like a graceful punch, and with its force I soar out onto the water, running along the waves like so many raised footholds. I see quickly that the horizon he spoke of is a literal thing; speeding toward the approaching blue wall of airy light, I look back to see him receding in the distance. He stands on the dock and raises a fist in a silent cheer once. At that, I understand that I will never see the kind man with the crooked nose againnot even in the realms of Death after Life, for he will not be travelling that direction with the rest of us. The sky hits, and I sail through heat and light, arms wide like imaginary wings. Alone for the first time, it dawns upon me that glorious other worlds and other forms of consciousness *do* exist. What wonders abound in the Dream Tessellations? There are peoples here; cities, streets, docks. There are beaches, oceans, and skies. My kind friend with the crooked nose met one of the forms of Death in person. Am I one step closer to the afterlife here? To the Truth of existence? Could I meet one of the forms of God here? Gods, entities, overseers, the lot? I only learned of these concepts moments ago by the measure of my life's span, and yet here I am, soaring through open blue in the realms of the mind on my way to challenge Death. What secrets does the vast sea of existence hold for us tiny creatures? Could we one day fight our way to the surface and see reality for what it is truly is? The fire of a million human hopes burns in a layer just below this one. That energy is my grounding, my footing, and my strength. I blaze along roiling white energy toward a limitless realm of darkness. Somewhere, my physical body is still falling, but I must ignore that dread and press on. The shadow behind me mirrors that fear, always following, but never interfering. I feel it. I am closer to the tide of fatigue and loss that comes from injury. I am closer to Death. My leaping run changes tone as I land and slide across smooth obsidian. The ocean is gone, the light is gone, and only darkness reigns. Tremendous drumbeats echo to infinity as black monoliths rise slowly from the landscape in every direction. Is my presence known? The world reacts to me, but not with intent. Bracing as smooth black glass trembles beneath me, I remain vigilant for attack as I risebut none comes. I have never felt smaller. In the enormity of this realm, I am but a blue spark upon endless void; I run, but I am so small that I hardly move in relative terms. The currents in the darkness take me into that vast realm, and I am no different than the othersand there *are* others. My living heart beats with the incomprehensible horror of eons as I stumble my way through the pitch among ashen and expressionless faces. I've seen this before. I've seen Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia like this as they sat in that movie theater of my mind while I brushed Death; they watched the play of my life with white faces, thin lips, and unfeeling eyes. Countless faces like theirs pass in the dark as their bearers drift toward their destination. It is cold, and panic burns through me. \" Silent moving monoliths the size of planets rearrange themselves in repeating geometric patterns. The dead, with their organic uneven faces, do not respond. I push at a grim woman of about forty, but she ignores my touch and continues plodding on. I grab the arm of a young man in his twenties, but his limb bursts into dust, and he continues mindlessly walking along glassy obsidian. Death lies ahead. They walk towards an impossibly massive black wall on the horizon without hesitation, slaves to their loss of will. Something in me knows that the wall is not solid. Worse, it is a passable membrane, and unknown horrors beyond imagination await on the other side. None can return. I scream at them and lay about with my fists, but my attacks have no effect. \" Don't do it! Stop, *please!*\" The scope is beyond comprehension. Millions trudge to their dissolutions in darkness; those that recently died, and those about to die. Time is blurred in this twilit realm. Their faces, their hollow expressions, leave their lives open like a litany of events. Bad people, good people, unremarkable people; all drift past in endless procession. There, a man from Amber Eight, who died when it exploded. There, a refugee girl and her parents who will die in a battle we have yet to fight against Her Glory Enraged. There, an old woman from the now-destroyed First World, dying of hunger on her exodus from the Empire. Everywhere I look, more lost souls moving into gloom. This is the correct place. This is the correct realm of Death. I've found itwhat now? I feel stupid. What did I expect? That Death would be a humanoid man that I could fight with my sword? I am nothing compared to the sheer size and scope of the worlds, realms, and layers of existence. My voice is nothing to the endless procession of ashen faces. \" Falling to my knees on obsidian, I can't help but sob. The massive drumbeat of the grinding black monoliths and the boundless silence of Death make all I am and all I have nothing but foolishness. I am going to lose everything and everyone I love and there is nothing I can do. \"Venita?\" On my feet, I look around in surprise. A smiling old man approaches, and I almost don't recognize him for all the time I've been away. \" Grandfather?\" Chill grips me. \" What are you doing here?\" \"Oh, just having a bad dream,\" he tells me, laughing and dismissing my fears. Gazing up at the clockwork sky of shifting obsidian cubes, he grimaces. \" Quite the nightmarish place you've found to sob in.\" Coughing awkwardly and wiping away my tears, I regard him for a moment before recognizing the truth of who he is. He hugs me back with force, and I tell him, \"How do I move forward? How does anything matter in the face of *this?*\" He lets off our hug and then holds up my wrist to show me the silver bracelet still upon it. \" You see this? This is a promise. You may not know the little girl that gave it to you after you saved her life, you may not be friends, and you may not see her again, but this is what we do for each other. We remember, and we care.\" He gazes ahead at the infinite black wall. \" That may lie ahead of us always and it may consume us all eventually, but it can never take away what we are. It will never *understand,* therefore it can never truly suppress us.\" Mystified, I ask, \"Grandfather... do you know what Death is?\" Quite serious, he nods. \" Of course, granddaughter of mine, and it is nothing to be worried about in the slightest.\" He raises his arms and enters a mock combat stance. \" For it can never touch those of us who come from a line of ancient heroes!\" All the pain of my own smallness fades as the giggle overtakes me. \" Grandfather, stop!\" My laugh only deepens as he continues making funny faces and acting out his tales. \" Now's not the time for a story!\" \"On the *contrary!*\" he shouts. \" Now is the perfect time to tell you of our ancestors yet again in the form of an incredibly long and convoluted yarn with no clear meaning. In that way, it is Life's tale! Just like us, it never ends. It just begins again!\" He leans close. \" Also, a strange little shadow is following us, and I hoped to confuse it.\" \"You see it too?\" I glance back at it briefly. \" It's been following me for a very long time.\" My grandfather flashes it a sour frown. \" Peeping tom.\" Turning toward the great Wall again, he spies a very different approaching form. His humor fades completely for the first time that I've ever seen. \" You've come seeking trouble, my granddaughter, and I believe you've found it.\" The spark of pure darkness approaches on a foul wind at terrifying speed. The drumbeat of the black realm deepens as it sweeps forth. In moments, it comes to a sudden halt high in the open air above us, and I see that it is the silhouette of a man; its cloak ruffles in the breezes of its own approach. He slowly draws two swords made of unfathomable void, and his voice feels like the very concept of aging upon my ears. * Is this what you wanted?* Struggling to stand against the waves of fatigue emanating from his mere presence, I shout, \"Are you him? Are you Death?\" *I wasn't,* he responds. * Until you called forth what you expected to see.* Even as I form my multi-tool into a sword and hold it up defensively, I realize that the weapon is just a construct of my mindbut judging by the nature of these realms, I bet that it will perform much the same as the real thing. Facing the silhouette above, I demand, \"You'd allow your enemy to choose your form?\" *It doesn't matter in the slightest to me. An endless wall, an inexhaustible opponentI could be a limitless fog if I really wanted to frustrate you. What would a poor little soldier like you do against an enemy you couldn't even hit?* I ready for a fight and glare. \" *No arrogance. Even existing as a singular entity or as an 'I' is a temporary condition created just for you; to crush your pitiful hopes. You are nothing but dust in Time's eye.* Why all the focus on demoralization? Waitdo I actually have a chance? Why would Death bother attempting to attack my morale? If I am the Sixth Millennial, do I actually have the ability to cause real change in the higher layers of existence? Instead of crushing me, his words have given me a sudden surge of hope. \" Then come at me, and we'll see.\" The cloaked silhouette floats down with both swords open and waiting. My pulse races dangerously in my awareness, and I let it churn blue fire through my every fiber. He brings one sword up and slowly angles it down towards me. I watch it warily. My grandfather's shout reaches my ears: \"Venita! It is only that warning that gives me the instinct to brace. Death's sword gently taps my weaponand the force beyond the contact is like a hurricane detonation in my face. Obsidian glass tears away from the monolith at my feet, and I nearly fall with the pain that rips through my limbs. I should have expected it, but the realityit'she's*impossibly* strong! The second strike is swifter, and I leap back to avoid the explosion of volcanic glass. The monoliths are rearranging faster now, responding in the same way the environment did to my sense of Time at the fire-sand beach, and I have to take every advantage I can get. The next one is rising, and I use it to gain height; he strikes not at me, but at its sheer side, and the monolith ruptures underneath me as I jump to the next rising surface. His icy whisper reaches my ears from every direction. * Feel free to give up and run.* I give no credence to his words. Instead, breathing hard, I desperately seek a strategy. Waitcould Iit's all metaphorical, but it's also real. Human hopes are *real.* I can feel that fire churning like a star inside my heart. Instead of letting it burn wildly within, what if I channeled it? Gathering up a burst, I wait until Death floats closerand then jump forward and set my sword ablaze. The flaming blade cleaves bright blue through the air. Death pulls back, aghast. A slight nick on his left arm glows bright from where I caught him, and drops of infinite blackness fall to shattered obsidian far below. His unseen stare became intense; he spits, *Oathbreaker!* I hold my blazing sword at the ready, wary of another play. \" *I just thought you a fool. Some do stray this way at times. This is what you do with your sacred trust?* \"I don't know what that means! I don't know what *any of this* means!\" The righteous fire within becomes painfully hot as I let it forth. \" I'm *tired* of meaning being held back from me. I want to *know*. I want to know if God or Gods exist. I want to know what happens after death. I want to know what these dream realms are.\" My final words come with the roar of a million desires. \"** Tell me the truth of existence!**\" Shaken, the cloaked silhouette turnsand shoots away at incredible speed. My grandfather calls up, \"Is this what you want, my granddaughter?\" \"It's not good enough,\" I shout back. \" We deserve better than what we've been given. All of us!\" \"I always was proud of you.\" Even at that great distance, I can see his smile. \" I'll be fine.\" What does he mean? I hadn't even thought aboutno, I shouldn't get distracted. Death is creating a great distance between us as he speeds toward the Wall. \" How can I possibly catch up to him?\" \"My last piece of advice, granddaughter. You were born for this in more ways than you know. When all this is done, find your father and ask him.\" Far below, he makes an opening motion with his arms. \" Stop holding yourself back. You'll know.\" The drumbeat of this realm is matched only by the beat of battle in my chest, and I suddenly understand that they are one and the same. Death, life, heartbeat, perceptionall the same. I've trained all my life for the proper mentality for this fight, and I've earned it by fire and then some. To take on the ultimate enemyyes. Jumping from my high obsidian perch, I let go of the constraints I've put upon myself by holding on. The people I love will still accept me. Of this, I am certain. Only their opinion matters, and their support is with me at all times. In many ways a mirror of my falling position in the real world, this time I face the open air with purpose, spreading my arms in the manner of a dreambut a dream it is not. The curve of force catches me and takes me up. Rather than falling, I shoot forward, suddenly in pursuit of the fleeing personification of Death. I don't have to look back; I know. They've always been there, but I was too terrified of standing out or being different to face the fact that I am not like other people. Here in the metaphorical realms of the Dream Tessellation, filled with the energy of countless hopes and beloved by the best people I've ever known, I can finally be myself. Like the multi-tool, this new part of me is an extension of my will, and this time I am not just running fast. I am truly flying. Burning sword held forward, I close with Death himself on wide wings of blazing blue fire. ---\n[+](<URL>)[+](<URL>)[+](<URL>)",

    "input_text": "[Title Game] Gnarly Wipe Out, Hang Loose Brah My cousin Larry and I are from Oregon. Going to the beach is a bit of a production there. It isn't what the typical person pictures in their mind when they think of the word \"beach.\" There's sand and water, but the similarities stop there. You can rarely see the sun through the thick fog, and instead of a bikini, you're more likely to find yourself wearing cold weather gear. But Larry wanted to learn to surf, so I rented a wetsuit and strapped a board on top of my car. I'm sure I looked ridiculous driving there. He struggled into the stretchy neoprene. It caused his arms to stick out at his sides a little like a doll. He looked so ridiculous. He started running toward the water. \"Hey Lar! Forgetting something?\" I said, pointing toward the surfboard still strapped to my car. He looked ridiculous, heading to the water holding a board that was twice as long as he was tall. I stopped him for a photo. \" Say, 'Hang loose, brah!'\" \"Hang loose bra!\" He giggled, and held up some unrelated gang sign. I took the picture. His smile faded, and he howled as his suit filled with the frigid water. It took him a long time to paddle the big board into the breakers. I could see him getting tired right away. I doubted he was having fun anymore now that he knew how much work this was going to be. When I saw a larger swell pushing up and rising over his small shape, I tried to yell to him. The riptides had been pushing him closer and closer to the rocky jetty. His board raised above him, overbalanced and toppled him. I saw the board, but I couldn't find him in the frothy wave. I waited a full minute. It felt like forever. Then I was scrambling up the rocks and out along the jetty. I just had to find him. Barnacles cut into my fingertips and salt water sprayed across my back. I was roughly to where I'd seen him. The white board was all the way to the beach already, floating with the fin in the air like a beached animal. I still couldn't see him or anything else under the dark water. The waves slapped against the rocks and sent spray flying into the air. Then I heard a scratching coming from underneath me, inside the large rocks. Sure enough, an opening appeared in a lull between waves. I tried to stick my head in and look inside. I saw a foot, and a little white hand. I dove after him. My clothes, wallet, phone, I didn't care. All that mattered was saving Larry. He might have weighed a thousand pounds of dead weight. Blood ran freely from his forehead, and his skin was all a sickly blue-tinted white. I clawed muscles and barnacles from the rocks trying to scurry my way up away from the accursed ocean. Larry's dead weight pitched me off balance and caused me to lose my footing. As I fell back into the ocean and a wave swept us apart, I realized that there were people on top of the jetty, watching. I screamed to them as I broke the surface. I found Larry again, but just as I reached him, another wave swept us under. I just managed to hold onto his leg this time. I was starting to get tired. My jacket was tangling my arms, and the hiking boots that I wore made it so that I had to kick twice as much to stay afloat. Larry looked dead. Then my foot touched the sandy bottom. I pushed him forward toward the beach. With my last remaining strength I dragged him out of the water. I was too cold to cry. Too tired to think. I pounded my fists on his chest. People gathered around me. I heard one of them say ridiculously, \"That was a gnarly wipe out.\" A man in a dirty yellow slicker mumbled \"Down with the ship.\" \"Help me!\" I screamed, but no one would come closer. They just watched from the edge of the circle. There was something wrong with their faces. They looked too much like Larry. Their skin was too blue. Too slack and lifeless...\nThen someone was screaming and running toward us. An elderly man took in the image of Larry, before wrapping me in strong arms and tearing me away. He forced me to get warm. The circle of others were gone. It was fifteen minutes before anyone else came to the beach. The man who rescued me stayed with me until the paramedics came. He told me \"There was nothing you could have done.\" \"Nothing I could have done? What about all those other people who just stood there and watched?\" \"You don't want to be talking about those others, ma'am,\" he said, seriously. The doors of the ambulance closed and I was carried away.",

    "input_text": "Anti-Aging How to (The real thing) and Tips for the youngest among us among other things. Update I recieved the go ahead and approval for the post and the next one. I will post about regaining sensitivity and resetting triggers to something more innocent for those in the preteen and Teen age group. This one will be labeled NSFW Thread three will be a Misc. thread that covers things such as haircuts, clothing, eyelashes, etc. Hi there, You can call me Jimmy (Not my real name but a nickname after Jimmy Neutron because I was so smart as a kid and everyone called me that). I am 11 years old. I was diagnosed with Aspergers at 11 years old which is coincidence. Like many of you I really am mentally and emotionally that young. And I do experience body dysphoria and if I were to be given the opportunity to jump back into my 11 year old body permanently I would jump at it. However I am not suicidal about it as I am more the type to do something about it for myself and others And I value my own life to much to ever consider it. And I don't mean advocacy as that is better left to those who dedicate everything to it. I mean real Actionable things you can do right now to keep yourself looking younger and closer to your real age. And I don't mean makeup. ( Barring some blush on the cheeks for the older among us.) I wont lie some of this costs money, some of it a lot of money. Some of it is free and some of it can be risky. But for the youngest in body among us it could be the only way of keeping their dysphoria in check semi permanently. I will put warning next to anything potentially dangerous and the money needed if applicable and most of it will only apply to the US. It will range from rejuvenating your body, some of these will have permanent consequences so you must be absolutely sure you could not live without it. I wont lie without knowing about this topic in detail I had fantasized and looked into halting puberty at that age with no feasible options and no money if I had known about what I am going to tell you about I would have jumped consequences or not. I will also put sources for those that have them and I will update this list as new information appears or community members have things to add that would compliment things. So please comment if you have anything to add. Now we start with the section that while dicey in places will greatly benefit the physically youngest among us. I will not lie your on a time limit and a very restrictive one as every pubertal change is not something easily reversed. It is also understandable that many of you will simply not have the capital available. Seemingly at least. But there are things you can do and they will serve you well and many will be permanent. However, you must first be absolutely sure that you are age dysphoric and that it will kill you inside to not look at or close to your true age. As until regenerative medicine progresses further these changes will be permanent and irreversible. Talk to a Psychologist first and keep this in your back pocket but make sure as you are a child. In many cases both physically and mentally. It will be significantly easier for you if you have your parents and psych on your side. As you won't have to go to cloak and dagger route and agonize on how to pay for things. Broach the idea slowly and carefully leverage your autism diagnosis if you have it. Make it abundantly clear that you will be destroyed if you physically grow up but don't get too whiny about it make your case that you already feel dysphoric in your body as it gets older and does not match your mental age. Bargain if you need to, make it clear that you're still going to study and put your best foot forward to get a job. If at any point unless your autism is that severe you make it known that you want to be taken care of like a child beyond love and affection your attempt will sour as many parents don't want that kind of burden. Remember it is more important that you keep your body looking how it should look. This way you can go through with the steps I'm going to list below but with parental approval and backing and hopefully a physician's supervision. You could even use the surprisingly low price as a selling point. If at the point you put your feelers forward you can see it would never be approved of or they would do horrible things to you, you will have to go to cloak and dagger route this is easier than it seems. The hardest part of the whole thing is getting a hold of the money. You can make this money by hopefully doing household chores and saving up as the first step will not take a lot of money. Otherwise you can perform a side hustle or ask around your neighborhood if anyone needs any chores done. You Will only need around $30 dollars on a visa gift card for this one and a safe place to send it to. Or better yet as part of your chores start bringing in the mail. This will give you chance to hide what you bought and use it later. When you've decided you've reached old enough what is the first thing on your to do list? Closing Bone Growth Plates. Girls have the short stick on this one is their growth finishes earlier than boys. With most reaching adult height at around 15. So the earlier the better for this one. Boys have a bit more leeway but the sooner it is done the younger you will look. There are two moderately safe ways to close the growth plates. High doses of estrogen or testosterone. An easily attainable way to do this is by taking a large and measured dose of birth control. Even the boys though you may have to worry about growing breasts if you continue doing so. If you have the option to though it might be more expensive it will be much better in the long term take the testosterone option instead. A very high initial dose will close the growth plates. Certain SARMS will also do so. But if you are low on time and money you need to take what you can get. [ <URL>](<URL>) You can get all of this from alldaychemist 2. Puberty Blockers and Anti Androgens: If you've gotten to this point hopefully you have your parents support as then you will be able to pursue the most ideal option which is an implant called ## [SUPPRELIN LA](<URL>) It will completely suppress puberty for at least one year. Without more permanent and damaging ways of preventing puberty this is the most sustainable and long term solution. With luck you can pretend to be gender dysphoric and just say you need time, that way the doctors will not only go out of their way to prescribe it for you but insurance just may cover it. Otherwise if you are very understanding doctors you may be able to get it anyways. Avoid Lupron though as the long-term side effects are coming out as very bad. If you are unable to get a hold of the other puberty blockers you may have to go the anti-androgen route. There is a tab dedicated to it on all day chemist. You can find Sarms on Science. Bio but expect to spend at least 70$. There is a possibility the implants can last for more than one year which would be even better. [ <URL>](<URL>) If you are able to do both of these things, you should basically be set. If you are already older than your real age at least you can prevent any more damage. For the older ones among us. Now we start with the first thing that will actually rejuvenate your skin and make you look physically younger. This will be expensive up front but the cost will lessen after the initial investment as you will only need to purchase certain items occasionally. Skin Care Shopping List and Rationale: 1:) Tretinoin : This is the most important part of the regimen, if you purchase nothing else or can afford nothing else this is what you should buy. It is one of the most scientifically studied skincare ingredients with decades of research outside of cosmetic companies. It is not a magic cure but over the course of several months of consistent application it will reduce and eliminate skin blemishes and wrinkles and help prevent the formation of new ones. Put a pea-sized dab on your face before you go to bed. Source Alldaychemist around 8$ per tube no prescription needed. Since starting to apply it my nascent frown lines have halfed. 2:) Skin Medica TNS recovery complex: This is the second most important part of the regimen. It is also the most expensive. It is a solution of over 300 growth factors and cytokines taken from human fibroblasts and is proven when applied over the course of around six weeks to double skin thickness and further reduce and eliminate wrinkles. Since starting to apply this my cheeks have gotten a little bigger and my eyelids have begun to look Dewey again. It is applied twice a day once at night and once in the morning and the single bottle will usually last 2 to 3 months. You may feel a slight burning sensation applying it after tretinoin. You should wait 30 minutes after applying tretinoin to apply this. These two are the only to you needed night. Source: Various sources Skin Medica. Price $60-200 Be careful of scams if going for the cheaper option. It should smell odd and a little organic or it is not real. 3:) Sunscreen: It should be Zinc Oxide and titanium Based. Source Various Price Various. 30-50 SPF 4:) AHA Cream: Morning exfoliation, in studies is proven to accelerate the the results of tretinoin as it operates by a different mechanism. Should be applied in the morning. Price various source various. 5:) Vitamin C Cream: This one should be simple, mono ingredient, and cheap. Apply after AHA and before sunscreen. 6:) Silk Pillowcases: As you get older you iron in wrinkles as you sleep on your side and your collagen production gets weaker. Cotton also sucks out the moisture from your face. The only thing proven in studies to not cause ironed in wrinkles is silk. You can also buy a silk eye mask. I myself use the one from Manta. Word of caution it should be silk not satin, this distinction is very important it should say only one hundred percent silk. 7:) A simple lotion for your body. I use Lush Cosmetics solid body lotion myself. Cost $12 8:) a simple body retinoid. I myself use something called retinoil which is $20. This will fade imperfections in your body. I am still trying to find something that will further fade white stretch marks and I will update this if I can. You can find this at your local drugstore usually. 9:) The last thing for skincare and the one that should only be used when you have discontinued the retinoids or anything that could make you more sensitive to light. Also the thing that could help a lot of us the most. I am talking about laser hair removal or any form of permanent hair removal. A lot of my discomfort would leave me if I did not have to look at body and pubic hair. And I'm certain that a lot of you feel the same. This one can take multiple sessions and until recently left out those who were darker skinned and have lighter hair colors. More recent advancements have made it available for them to. However is expensive and requires multiple sessions. A more permanent but just as expensive and little more lengthy procedure is called electrolysis. This one kills the hair follicle. But it can be painful. The cost for this one can be iffy. You might have to game the system and pretend to have gender dysphoria to get hair removal covered by insurance. You're only half lying as you do suffer from dysphoria (unless you also suffer from gender dysphoria). Otherwise you are looking at a minimum investment of $2000 but it will be probably be closer to $6000 the good news is that this is basically a one time expense. Once it is done you at most have to perform some maintenance sessions every few months in certain areas but you may not have to do it all. Edit: (2/09/21) 10:) In addition to the retinoid for the body I have found one thing that is empirically backed for the fading of stretch marks. It is something called bio-oil. They have a website. Now we move on to health and Exercises: Little Boys and Girls are generally thin and limber. And if you were able to portray that image and demonstrate that ability you will be looked at as younger. Thin does not necessarily mean super skinny as if you are too thin you will look much older than you really are and cause severe health issues and damage to yourself that will make you look older. A notable example are some of the pictures you see of vegan men in San Francisco. A lot of them look like Holocaust victims and even though many of them are in their early 20s they look like they're in their 50s. For that reason unless you do it for religious reasons I cannot recommend veganism at all as none of their assertions about health hold up to scrutiny and the \"studies\" are often found to be fraudulent. Now if you were on a vegan diet for moral reasons I commend you but just know you are making things harder for yourself. Vegetarianism is doable but will require supplementation and Eggs. Most of us here seem to be on the autism spectrum. For that reason and it's 30 years of study despite its detractors I recommend you begin a gluten-free casein free diet. It helped clear up bowel issues I have had forever. And cleared up Acne I have had on my arms for as long as I can remember. Follow the caloric intake recommendation for your age and sex unless you are overweight. In that case you must operate at a caloric deficit. A good cookbook to follow is this one [<URL> amp;psc=1](<URL> amp;psc=1) I also greatly recommend the autism nutrition research Center Regiment. [ <URL>](<URL>) it can be expensive but it is research-based, and it is no more expensive than each of the ingredients purchased separately. Sleep: Little boys and girls have bed times. That means 9 o'clock sharp no exceptions. ( Unless you work) You should be getting the 10 hours of sleep your body demands. This means practicing good sleep hygiene such as taking your electronics out of your room buying and using bluelight glasses. Installing bluelight filters on your electronics. Combined with the skincare regimen above this should alleviate your dark circles which should make you seem younger. The idea that increase sleep lessons your lifespan has been disproven. Exercise: Little Boys and Girls Club are fit, thin and limber. Generally as well they have round perky bottoms and thin appendages. Depending on your build, getting too thin can actually be counterproductive and make you look older. I am not going to lie even if you do everything perfectly and manage to do everything I am listing and will continue to list your build will limit how young you can look. But You can optimize your physique to make yourself look younger. Everything should be mostly proportional, for example if you are big and bulky your arms and legs should be within the range of the rest your body. You should have muscle but it should not be well-defined, but you should also try to limit fat as much as you can but not too much as a small layer of fat can stand in for baby fat if controlled properly. It will take some doing but the ideal is to be proportional with a small layer of fat to create a slightly chubby childish look. That does not mean you should be chubby just that it should be look like you have baby fat. I mentioned it earlier one of the big things people overlook and will give you a way if nothing else does is your butt. Children almost universally up to the late teenage years have well-defined and rounded glutes. Some people would call this diaper butt even though no diapers are involved. This is especially true for boys, and is this perspective I'm speaking from. There are other guides for women but the ideal is you want to avoid making your thighs bigger while making your butt perkier. [ <URL>](<URL>) This website is a good place to start and is funnily enough aimed at women. Another place to look is a website and workout plan called autism fitness. Some of them are useless if you are not developmentally delayed enough for them but others are perfect for our purpose as our goal is to gain lean muscle and flexibility not bulk. For me personally I do bear walks, dead bugs, squats, sidesteps, glue bridges both weighted and unweighted, Russian swings, overhead band presses, and moderate weight bench presses. Ultimately the exercises that are perfect for you, you have to find in your own. There is a last exercise I can recommend to everyone that will definitely make you look younger and further reduce the appearance of wrinkles if you have them and prevent their appearance if you don't. It is called facial yoga. Basically it's an exercise routine for your facial muscles primarily your cheeks, this avoids the sunken look and if you start young enough or will you still have enough volume you can preserve and look much younger than you normally would even with the steps mentioned above. Combining these with some of the geroprotectors, research chemicals, and other substances in the next section and depending on how old you look you will be able to target a presenting age. Which while probably not your actual age should be significantly better than what you experience currently. Calm down look at yourself in the mirror and see what you can fix and change. How old will that make you look? Make that your target. For a lot of us that presenting age will be somewhere in your teens. Not ideal but significantly better than would be possible otherwise. For myself based on my old photos and what I currently look like in my early 20s I could easily shoot for and maintain the looks of someone who is 14. With a stretch goal if some of the things I am investigating pan out of 13 to 12. If I could make it to looking like I was 12 I would be within spitting distance of my actual age and I would be happy with it. But if it doesn't 14 will have to do. When I say 12 I mean what I look like when I was 12 same thing with 14. You could easily just say you're a tall kid. I will hopefully coin a phrase: Your Presenting Age Goal. The goal of looking as close to your true age as is feasibly possible. Geroprotectors and other research compounds: Geroprotectors are compounds that prevent and reverse aging in physical adults. They include peptides, regenerative medicine, and certain research chemicals and non-FDA approved pharmaceuticals which are safe and tested elsewhere. A big thing to look at are the Khavinson peptides. Many of them have studies behind them to present their efficacy and they were developed for the Soviet Union super soldier program which became defunct after the fall. If you have heard of elderly individuals having young blood plasma transfusions to be young again these peptides operate upon the same principle. They make your body repair itself. One in particular would be very important especially among those who have had a destroyed sleep schedule and want to present as younger. That is Endoluten the Pineal Peptide. This extends the telomeres of the body and more importanly fixes your circadian rhythms so you will fall asleep and wake up as a child with the falling of darkness and coming of day. Looks are only half the equation, the other half is how you outwardly present in one of the best ways to seem younger even if you don't look it is hyperactivity. For that reason the adrenal peptide GlandoKort also comes recommended as it will restore some of that hyperactivity. The only other two I would recommend as essential, depending on your individual needs of course is ventfort the blood vessel peptide. Increased blood flow to areas will not only make you more alert it will also make you look younger by renewing the blood supply in places and giving you that childish blush. And Sigumir the cartilage peptide. This will not only have an extremely positive effect in your skin but more importantly shore up your cartilage and allow you to increase your flexibility and further reduce the age you present as. [ <URL>](<URL>) I buy mine from here, but if you look you can find it elsewhere. Make sure to buy the Russian branding not the American branding as the 60 capsules only come with the Russian. Now we move on from generally safe peptides to the riskier research chemicals. This post as long as heck as it is so I will only list each chemical what it can do for you how it can make you present as younger and safety considerations. NSI-189: Your emotions will be more intense and much more like a child's, you may be mentally a child but your body's hormones may have \"matured\" out of that stage causing an emotional disconnect. It was investigated first as a smart drug by DARPA and is now being developed and marketed as an atypical antidepressant but it is not an SSRI. It will improve your memory and make it more like a child's as its primary mechanism of action is by increasing BDNF and increasing the size of the hippocampus. This one has been tested extensively and its effective dose is 40 mg increasing the dosage will not increase the effects it will actually lessen the effects. You can look up any contradictions in scientific studies performed upon this. Reputable source = [Science.bio](<URL>) I currently take this one. 9-me-bc: As long as you don't do drugs you will take greater pleasure and every day things and will restore \"the magic\". Many of you probably were put on ADHD medication, this works by down regulating dopamine receptors. This research chemicals on the other hand has been found to regenerate them even dead ones. You only need to take it for at most six weeks and you will need to avoid the sun like a vampire or put on sunscreen in that time. But the results are completely worth it. If you search on Reddit you might find traces of it being viewed as neurotoxic. There is no evidence of this as all compunds in this class do not have the same effect. Preliminary in vitro testing actually shows a neuroprotective effect. Reputable source = [Science.bio](<URL>) I also took this one but only for six weeks to repair early damage of ADHD medication. Cerebrolysin: I recently learned that I suffered from trauma induced alexithymia. PTSD, depression, and other traumas are actually a form of brain damage. This Russian peptide medication is primarily prescribed for that purpose. It is very safe and is been in use for over 70 years and has more than 400 human studies in several hundred more on animals. Why haven't you heard about it than? Because none of the studies are in English and the FDA doesn't consider any study not done in English to be credible. ( Yes I am serious) I recently finished a 30 day regimen of Cerebrolysin for 30 days. It did three big things for me. It restored my ability to feel emotions though I still need to learn interoception skills I never learned. It further expanded my awareness of the world and of myself. And it reopened the development period allowing me to start recognizing facial micro expressions and other conversational nuances that were beyond me before. It is also what gave me the awareness to realize I was an 11-year-old flying by the seat of his pants and gave me the nuance to look back on some of my actions \"growing up\" in a new light. I had always sought to recapture my childhood and remained looking as young as possible. A lot of my past and current behavior started to make sense in hindsight and present more evidence that I was mentally 11 even if I was intellectually much older. The benefit of this is you will better be able to judge situations and physically and emotionally express yourself which will serve the purpose of making you seem younger and simultaneously more polite so even if the people you're talking to see through you they are more likely give you the benefit of the doubt. It is intramuscularly injected so you will need to take time to learn how to do it safely if you so choose. Remember there is no pressure and you can take or leave whatever I present to you. The only legitimate source in the West to buy it is Rupharma. For older individuals that are of course numerous hormonal and other interventions you can partake in but I will not list them as they are up to you. That is all I have for now. I hope it can help some people. Or if it is considered too dangerous I apologize and will remove the post.",

I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.",

    "input_text": "Recently Opened Documents How well do you pay attention to your list of recently opened documents? Last night, when tracking down a file I had worked on, I spotted an unfamiliar filename on the list: ryansjournal.docx. Privacy be dammed, I read it. I wish I hadnt. A whole day has gone by, and I still cannot shake the goose bumps: the content wasdisturbing, to say the least. Take a look:\n**Entry 1 - July 2nd, 2014:**\n*My name is Ryan and Im 11 years old. Im writing this journal for a time capsule Im burying. Hi, older me! Hope you made it as a firefighter!* *Me and mom moved this week. Theres a lot of boxes everywhere. I dont like it here. Its really small. I miss my big backyard with the pool and all the oak trees. I used to climb them and pretend I was king of the forest. There are no trees here. Just a fence and a bit of grass. I dont know anyone here. The worst is that its REALLY creepy at night. The shadows in my room look like theyre about to reach out and grab me. Im too old for a nightlight so I snuck a flashlight under my pillow so mom wont ask questions.* My intention in moving was simple: shorten my commute to work and lower my bills. I was wasting so much money heating up an entire house, when a two-bedroom apartment did the job. The apartment is in the basement, so it requires less AC in the summer and less heating in the winter. As an added bonus, the place is pitch black at night. The master bedroom in my old house overlooked a street lamp. Not even the blackest of curtains could keep the light from shining in and, as a result, I had trouble falling asleep. I sleep like a baby in this apartment. **Entry 2 July 16th, 2014:**\n*Mom finished unpacking. She must have forgotten a few boxes, because I dont have any toys to play with. I still dont have any friends because mom wont let me go to the park. She said Ill make new friends when school starts. I think shes just too lazy to show me the way to the park. This sucks! I hate it here! I hate HER! Shes the WORST! I wish I had someone to talk to! I want to go home! Every night, the shadows get closer and closer to my bed and I scare them away with my flashlight. Im afraid the batteries will die.* **Entry 3 July 30th, 2014:**\n*Today, I made a new friend!!! His name is Deacon and he lives in my closet behind a super-secret door Im not supposed to tell mom about. Hes really fun. His favorite color is green, just like me! I hope me and Deacon will be friends forever. He likes all the same food as me and plays all the same games! Hes older and a little scary-looking, but I dont mind. He even told me he could protect me from the shadows at night.* **Entry 4 August 13th, 2014:**\n*I asked mom if Deacon could have supper with us tonight, but she ignored me. She was on her computer again, looking at weird symbols all evening. I grabbed an extra plate of food after supper and took it to my room for Deacon. He loved the ground beef but didnt touch the peas. I cant blame him. Peas are gross!* I work as a Web Developer at a University, and August is our busiest time of the year. Its not unusual for me to have to do a bit of overtime in the weeks leading up to the start of the Fall semester. I suppose HTML code can look a lot like weird symbols to the untrained eye. I can read HTML like you would read a book. Its like my mind automatically renders the tags into their intended format. I suppose to others, it must be as foreign as sheet music is to me: I do not understand it and all I see are a bunch of dots on a half-dozen lines. **Entry 5 August 27th, 2014:**\n*Mom still wont let me invite Deacon for supper, so I have to sneak food to him every night. She keeps telling me Deacon isnt real. She says Im too old to have an imaginary friend. I told her to go suck a turdsicle. She didnt like that. I was sent to my room. I hate her. Deacon is real! Hes my best friend! He even crawls into bed with me at night to protect me from the scary shadows in the room. He holds me so tight that I cant move sometimes. He says as long as were together were safe. I believe him. I see the shadows scurrying away and up the wall whenever he crawls over.* **Entry 6 September 24th, 2014:**\n*Sorry I didnt write for a while. I started school and had SO MUCH homework. Mom wont let me on the computer unless Im done. 5th graders get a LOT of homework. By the time Im done, moms on her stupid websites and wont let me have my turn. Why cant we have two computers like a normal family?!!??!?! At least I have Deacon to talk to. Mom doesnt like it when she hears us talk. She says its not healthy to talk to myself. Shes a triple-stupid dumb-shake with a cherry on top! If shed just let him eat with us, shed see hes real.* A crudely drawn [MS Paint doodle](<URL>) was included with this entry. On it, I can make out Ryan with a tall, dark figure looming over him, holding his shoulders. The man has long, claw-like fingers, big dark holes for eyes, and a large gaping smiling mouth with sharp fangs. He seems to be looking at my cat, who is cowering in the corner of the room. **Entry 7 October 8th, 2014:**\n*Deacon isnt happy. Mom found his hiding spot. She got rid of all his stuff!!! Hes hiding in the ceiling now. Theres a little crawl space where the air conditioner goes. Hes in there right now. I can hear him grunting. Hes so upset. Mom needs to apologize if she knows whats good for her.* I did find a little door in the walk-in closet. I opened it up and got a face full of dust. There were a few boxes of trinkets, which I assumed belonged to the apartments previous owners. I tossed them out. Who needs old rags, magazines, and worn shoes? I found the small storage space after hearing skittering noises in the walls. I wasnt sure if mice had gotten in, or if the apartment was crackling from the cold outside. I never dreamed I would find the perfect place to store winter apparel. I cleaned it up and filled it with coats and boots. **Entry 8 October 22nd, 2014:**\n*Deacon couldnt come and protect me last night because mom left my bedroom door open. He said he doesnt want her to see us together. She might make him go away if she saw him and the shadows. I was so scared. I cried myself to sleep. I needed his big strong arms to protect me. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw shadows crawling towards me. They lifted from the floor and made squishy noises like they were made of slime putty. I screamed for my mom but she didnt come. One of the shadows got on the bed and I felt it crawling towards me. Threw my flashlight at it. It must have landed on the switch, because it lit up and the shadows disappeared under the bed.* I remember keeping the door open because the room smelled awful and desperately needed to be aired out. I always keep the door shut so at least one room is devoid of cat fur. I would have opened the window instead of the door, but it has been stuck since the move and no amount of force has managed to pry it loose. I had no choice but to leave the door open all day and overnight. I was pleasantly surprised that the cat did not even try to step foot inside. **Entry 9 November 5th, 2014:**\n*Mom has been keeping my door open. Deacon is getting really angry with her. He says hes going to have to deal with her soon. I warned her Deacon was getting mad, but shes still insisting Deacon isnt real. Stupid stupid stupid. Deacon is watching.* That entry is the last one in the journal. If that wasnt creepy enoughheres the really weird thing: Im single and I live alone with my cat. I do not nor have I ever- had a child. I dont know what to say: maybe its a bad prank, but I checked the file properties and it was created in July and last updated on November 5th. I havent had houseguests since late October. My computer is not synched up to any device, nor does it have the capability to do so. I noticed the entries are typically written every other Wednesday, so I am curious to see if there will be a new one tomorrow. If there is, I will give you guys an update. **Update (November 19th, 2014):** I barely slept last night. I decided to check the journal before I went to work. I dont even know what to say. To say that I am horrified is putting it lightly. Here is the entry:\n**Entry 10 November 19th, 2014:**\n*Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for youunless the shadows get you first.* I think I am going to stay at a motel tonight. **Update (November 24th, 2014):** I just wanted to give you guys an update. I think I am freaking myself out over nothing. Ever since I read the journal, I keep seeing things move around in the dead of night. Around 3:00 a.m. this morning, I got up to use the restroom and saw my cat standing in the kitchen. He walked towards his food bowl and I heard a familiar crunching sound. I left him alone and went back to bed. As I slipped under the covers, my foot grazed my cat's head and he gave me an insulted, half-asleep meowl. There's no way he ran past me from the kitchen into my room: the hallway is too narrow. I would have seen or felt him. I was probably just sleep-deprived and imagined seeing him in the kitchen. People asked to see the drawing I found in Ryan's journal. It has been uploaded: [Ryan's Drawing](<URL>)",

    "input_text": "Haha, so, the funny thing is, mine is that and also backwards but I've been wanting to vent so here goes. I was a very hyperactive child. Not the run around in circles and fight people kind, the cantstopfidgetingohmygod kind. My mom worked in education and decided to have me observed by the school. They tell her it's because I have ADHD. So she takes me to therapy but tries to weasel her way into every appt. The therapist realizes this and starts asking me \"you're big enough to have this appointment alone, right?\" And I would always nod and my mom would always do and say awful things to try to get me to fess up as to what I had told the doc. I think she was taking me for appearances, and to tell the therapist that I was just acting up for her, as she did and does often. She kind of realized that taking me might backfire because the therapist wasn't an idiot. Guess who magically got better and didn't have to go to therapy anymore? And then when I was still hyped out of my mind and couldn't write a single sentence without wanting to die, she would say I was just being lazy/whiny and being bad. She would say that I did it at home too, but only when I had to actually focus and do things but that she was sure I was faking it. The other teachers at my school, where she worked, believed her. Son of a bitch. Later, when I was 11 and already showing signs of depression, she would scream at me for crying or for not being cheerful about some bullshit that I hated or for not immediately praising her for things. When I really started to retreat into my room more, she would yell that I deserved to be there anyway and I could stay there until I grew up and got a better attitude. I was self harming by 13 and miserable and she didn't give a shit. I was in an awful place by the time I was 13, but I kept up appearances alll the way until Junior year. I was in clubs, on teams, I was doing just okay in classes. Then I crashed. I failed all of my classes and they made me go to a special school where I could make it up. I knocked two years of classes out in six months. Without a full class of people, I could focus! I could go outside and do my work and finish a weeks worth in an hour and a half! I went back to regular school with enough credits that I could have already graduated, but I wanted to go to prom and stuff so I went back. My mom had zero interaction with this school. But the weird thing is she would tell me how proud she was of me for working hard to make it up. She almost never put me down for being in that school. The ONE thing she should have gotten mad about. W\nSo here's where it gets funny - she used to kick me out allllll the time. For various infractions. I think I was 14 the first time this happened. And then she'd call and beg me to come home and say she was sorry, and I was a fucking idiot doormat so I'd walk home with my tail between my legs and she'd cry and hug me and then the next day she'd be yelling again. ( Guess who's bipolar? But that's actually only a little relevant.) She would tell everyone at school that she didn't know what was going on with me, that I'd just disappear sometimes and not answer the phone and wouldn't tell her where I was going. School counselor called me in. By this time my mom didn't work for the district anymore and had switched careers. This counselor, who had already thought I was lazy and awful for having to go to the other school, mostly ignored me when I told her my mom was actually kicking me out and had hit me several times in the past and committed abuse by taking away \"privileges\", some as easy as TV and some like \"laundry and shower\". Didn't care. Thought I was acting up. Enter - me, 19. I am flunking my second semester of college after barely scraping by in the first. I hate college. I feel like an idiot and I'm not as put together as these other people. I flunk out and start working. I meet my FH just before I turned 21 and moved into his place 2 weeks later. His roommates all bail. In the interim, we have to find a place to stay. Guess who has the only open room in town? At least FH got to experience how she treated me. She only did it when she thought he wasn't there, but he's quiet. He saw and heard everything. We move out again. At that point, I'm 23 and completely unsure if I was actually ill or if she'd twisted it all up. It takes me two years to get help because A: I am scared and B: it takes me that long to actually call the abuse what it was. Turns out I'm not only ADHD and have full on depression, but I also have a panic disorder and show many signs of PTSD! I don't obviously tell her any of these. In the last two years, she has started pretending we have a great relationship now and she's always talking about how I'm \"sooo much better after getting help\" and that I was a terrible and difficult child to raise because of my ADHD and mood issues. The fuck. You claimed that I both did and did not have these things. Made them worse. Kept me from getting treatment and turned my teachers against me. And now you're saying I was difficult because of the illnesses that you couldn't make up your mind about?",

    "input_text": "Voices of Recovery - Daily Meditation: Dec 20 December 20 Step Two offers hope that sanity is possible, and at the same time it implies that, in our addiction, we were insane. Sex Addicts Anonymous, page 25 When I first read this sentence, I had to pause and ask myself if I were truly insane. Step One required me to admit that I am a sex addict and a sexual anorexic, that I am powerless over these illnesses, and that my life is unmanageable by me. Since I believe that I am a sex addict and a sexual anorexic, that means I have a disease of the mind, body, and spirit that reacts very negatively to all sexual stimuli. For me, unhealthy sexual stimuli can lead to addictive sexual behaviors, and healthy sexual stimuli, such as sexual intimacy with my husband, can lead to sexual avoidance or addictive sexual behaviors. But, being a sex addict also means I have a mental obsession with sexual stimuli of all kinds. To me, thats like someone with a peanut allergy having a mental obsession with finding and eating peanuts. Wouldnt I call that person insane? Yes, I would. So it clearly means that I am, in fact, insane. Without God and the SAA program, my default desires are to harm myself with addictive sexual behavior and starve myself of healthy sexuality. Believing God can restore me to sanity means believing that God will change my whole being so that I no longer desire harmful sexual stimuli and I no longer avoid nurturing sexual stimuli, one day and one step at a time.

So I want to make this clear. I am a good guy and if you don't believe me, read everything below. The only 2 things I do with my long distance girlfriend is playing videogames and chatting about NON-sexual topics. I do NOT have any sexual desires with my girlfriend. The only reason I \"date\" her online is because I love playing videogames and chatting with her. We are not really dating anyway, we are basically \"best friends\" but the small difference is that we agreed on an official relationship. That doesn't mean much, it **doesn't mean there is alot of romance or anything sexual**. She lives her own life and I'm not too involved with her anyways. And no, **I do not want her to move to my country**. I did first but I realized it was a mistake. She is too young for such decision so I really don't want her to do that. About the 5 years age gap, you can have your opinion that it is too big, but I simply disagree and you really don't have to hate me for not sharing your opinion. If I am a 40 year old man dating a 10 year old child, that would be a big issue, but cmon 21 and 16 is not an extreme difference **especially because I do nothing sexual or weird with her.** You may think it's a too big gap, but since that is your opinion and it also isn't an extremely big gap, you should really not show so much hate to me. We simply disagree about something small. Pedophilia is disgusting and I am against it. Because I'm not one of them.",

About three weeks ago I stopped looking at porn/masturbating and felt incredibly strong in my faith. Oddly enough, the temptations became stronger as I felt my hormones rising daily. My hope was to have a wet dream - so I'd feel blameless etc etc. I didn't and just today I suddenly gave in and now I feel super guilty. But people alert me that guilt is not from God, and that it's not through anything we do that gets us to Heaven but through Christ alone and what He did on the cross. So, why do I still feel this incredibly amount of guilt when I should, quite possibly, be joyous that even in my lows, Jesus still loves me? Thanks\nPS - also, I gave in kind of after I felt that I had received what I wanted, which was a passing grade on a huge certification exam. I told myself that didn't play into it and that I just wanted to love and obey God, but I feel that after getting what I wanted, my selfish motives were presented 10 fold.

    "input_text": "There Can't be Two People Living in This Room There Cant Be Two People Living in This Room\nIs this a help me post? My prideful side says it isnt but that guys an asshole; help me. ******\nIll get straight to it. Theres someone else in this room. How do I know this? I find her hair every day in places that range from meh to what the hell?, if that makes any sense. Ive also found her journal. I know, I know; narrator-finds-spooky-journal-in-room-events-begin-to-unravel-BOOM-Paranormal Activity\nIts not like that, I promise. *****\nMaybe I should start from the beginning\nMy commander moved me into this room in a rush. Yes, Im in the Army and this is a barracks room. Its meant for two people to coexist in with very little privacy; two beds, two desks, two lamps, two trash cans, two sinks, two night stands, one toilet, one shower, one door, one window. Two closets. Two closets that lock. Theres the shred of privacy this room offers: a closet that locks. That said, Im the only one in here. Well, at least I thought I was. The day I moved in here, I inventoried the room. Inventoried is a trumped-up phrase that basically means I looked around the room to make sure it was suitable for human usage and then threw all my shit in the closet and went to bed. I think I signed for the room and everything in it, but then again I may not have. All I really know is that I sleep here. And I havent been sleeping well. I remember that the first morning I woke up here, I got out of bed, went to the bathroom, got in the shower, and proceeded to pull one very long, black hair out from behind my ear as I scrubbed my head. I have red hair. I am a male. Males in the Army arent allowed to have hair that sheds at almost 10 inches in length. Thus bringing me to the conclusion that this was a females hair. I brushed the occurrence off; Im married and know the perturbation that is finding my wifes hair literally everywhere all too well. I told myself, It must have come from somewhere. Ill just deep clean the room and vacuum and get rid of all of it, even if I cant see it. So I did. Its called a G.I. Party and basically you strip the room bare of furniture and go to town on that motherfucker with a mop, scrub brush, some water, some bleach, and some carpet cleaner. Everything gets a good coating of water and bleach (maybe Pine Sol if youre really trying hard), the carpet gets scrubbed by hand, and then you rinse everything off and let it dry for a couple hours before you hit the carpet with a vacuum and then move all the furniture back in. Clean as a whistle, right? Obviously not. I woke up the next morning and got in the shower. There was a single, long, black hair stuck to the wall of the shower. I know it wasnt there before. But there it was. A few nights later, I noticed that this room really gets dark. I mean, like, cant-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark. This is an odd observation, because this barracks is notorious for soldiers putting up black out curtains on their windows in light, literally, of the fact that the windows sit situated in that perfect position where the sun blinds you in the morning as it comes up, and burns you up in the evening as it sets. But not my room. It gets *dark* in this motherfucker. Weird, right? Its a bit ominous to be housed in a room that seems to relish the pitch black, and Ill admit that, every so often, I wonder if theres something moving behind the black veil that envelopes this room every night. *Okay*, Ive thought to myself, *this rooms a bit unsettling, but youre a reasonable person, do the math. Work the problem.* Alright, the room can be opened one of two ways: either by card key, kind of like a hotel, or by hard key, like any normal door. Okay, Im the only one with a hard key other than the master that all the sergeants have. But is a sergeant coming in this room and leaving her hair in my shower, one strand at a time? Answer: most likely not; none of the female sergeants in this company know where Im staying because Im just assigned here temporarily. Plus, thats weird and I cant see a sergeant doing that to be creepy. Theres way too many Army regulations against being a creep, anyway. So maybe its another regular soldier whos getting in with their access card or something; maybe someone who stayed in this room who can still get in? Answer: The card reader is broken. I put in a request for the batteries to be changed in it but the maintenance guy said the thing is just broken and needs to be replaced. So nobodys getting in that way. So, thus far, my conclusions led me to a fairly solid understanding that I am one of very few people who can get through this door and that there are even fewer who would do so for some dubious reason like leaving their long, black hairs scattered about. Hell, I dont even think theres a black-haired member of the cadre in this company anyway. Yet I keep finding hair. Sometimes it'll be in my boot. Other times, I'll find it hanging limply from the back of one of the chairs. I'll find the hair in a pocket of a uniform, or, more disturbingly, laying across my face when I wake up. Moving on. Then comes the third observation: Something or someone pissed on my bedding, and it wasnt me. I woke up two mornings ago to the extremely strong and familiar scent of urine. Ive worked in EMS and around animals enough to know what piss smells like. This particular aroma was a combination of dehydrated human and very rotten, old cat. It was gross. The issue was that when I went to bed, my bedding didnt smell like that. And, on top of that, I didnt even use the bedding that night; I slept under my woobie, which any respectable Army member knows all about. I love my woobie. CIF can go fuck themselves if they think Im turning it back in when I ETS. But yeah, my blankets absolutely reeked of this hybrid urine stink. I threw them in the trash yesterday. I can deal with most gross stuff, but piss-ruined things just go in the garbage, fuck salvaging them. The smell usually never washes out anyway, so why bother? Now, I certainly didnt piss on the bedding. And I doubt that any sergeant from this company, wearing a wig of long, black hair and carrying one very old and dehydrated cat, did either. So who did? Heres my guess: Amy-Lynn did it. *Who the hell is Amy-Lynn?!,* you may be asking. Amy-Lynn left her journal in this room. Amy-Lynn may also have left herself in this room. Her journal starts off innocently enough, chronicling her decision to join the military and how proud she wanted to make her family and young daughter. I honestly felt bad for opening her private notebook, but she turned out to be a pretty good and coherent writer and I sort of enjoyed reading her journey through the initial entry into the military. At some point, though, she started to have trouble. She fought. She had an attitude with the cadre. She got fired from leadership positions. She fought some more. She missed home. She had to write essays on the importance of discipline. She missed home some more. It got pretty rough for her, from the look of it. But that happens to everybody, in some fashion when you're just starting out; I knocked a kid out in BCT because he refused to pronounce my name correctly. Still dont know why that mattered so much to me at the time, but fuck if he was going to screw my name up anymore on purpose, you know? Yeah, anyway, Amy-Lynn *really* started going through some shit, though. Her notes started to ramble. Her handwriting got worse. She started journalling later and later at night (she time stamped every note). And she started forgetting words in sentences; a misplaced the, or absent, and, occurring more frequently. Im not sure what exactly was happening with her, but to me it seems a little bit like a mental break. Like she just couldnt process everything fast enough and stuff started to snowball on her, you know? Her last entry fumbled through an account of how she fought with her roommate and the other girl ended up getting switched to a different barracks room because of it. So Amy-Lynn ended up alone in this room, at some point, while dealing with what I believe to be a psychotic melt down. As far as I know, these barracks have been here for at least 10 years, and the females stopped living anywhere but the fourth floor about 3 years ago. Which means Amy-Lynn lived in this room from anywhere between 2006 to 2013. I sincerely hope she has not been in this room that long. For her sake and mine. Mainly mine. Fuck this room gets dark. Ive got my computer brightness turned down so it doesnt burn my retinas out, but it sincerely feels like Im typing this from the inside of a black velvet box. And all the while I get the feeling that there are eyes on the other side of the room; watching and waiting. Watching and waiting. Can you help me figure this out? Anything would be appreciated.",

I lived on the margaritas and everything else I could fit into my mouth diet. One day I woke up, looked at myself in the mirror and had a complete breakdown. After that I decided to turn my life around and live to the age of 30. Truthfully, and this will sound stupid but I saw this picture of Chris Pratt and it really, really hit home (<URL>)\nStarted by writing literally everything I ate down in a journal while also keeping track on my phone. I was a big guy but consistently ate around 1,500 calories a day and between 30-50g of carbs. At the hell out of chicken, kale and eggs. I would walk for an hour every day at an incline and saw dramatic changes.

He has me doing a mix of resistance/weight training with some weighted cardio mixed in. I meet with him two days a week and do strict cardio by myself on the other days.

September 1, 2013. ---\nLooking back, I wonder if I was crazy before I even left. That was four days ago, when I loaded into my Volkswagen Rabbit and headed into the New Mexico desert for the night. To think... At that point I would have done anything to just run away. That car had never been a real winner. I bought it off a kid from my high school as he left for college. It was a washed out silver/blue piece of shit that he'd spray painted a skull and crossbones onto the front. And to top it off, I knew fuck all about cars. So when it broke down about 4 hours from the last time I saw a paved road and started pissing oil and billowing steam from the engine, I was helpless. I checked my phone, standing on top of the car and just saw one middle finger of a signal bar pop up before the battery died and the screen went black. I was silently furious. Furious with myself for pushing the limits of how far I could get out into the blank desert. Furious with my mom for getting arrested and making me have to move out here to New Mexico with my dad in the first place. The sun started to go down, and I started walking. I couldn't follow the rabbit's tracks because I knew there was nothing at all back that way. So I picked a direction perpendicular to them, South I guess, and started walking. I wasn't really sure how worried I should have been at that point. I just figured that I'd have to find something. I should have been a lot more concerned. I walked as far as I could that first night. Without the sun it got cold and harder to maintain my direction. I walked for hours. Sometimes humming songs to myself, sometimes yelling for help, sometimes yelling curses at my parents. After a while though, I just walked. I slept that morning until the heat and the light woke me up, then started walking again. All I remember is walking, walking on with my eyes closed against the harsh white brightness of the desert. When the darkness came again I sat and rested my legs. My mind was blank and numb from the day. Burned away from the sun. I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired. In the middle of the night I started walking again. I had to get out. Another day like that could kill me. I started hearing things in the darkness. Scuffles of animals moving, following me. Waiting for me to drop dead. It was only a few eternities into the next day when I saw a building in the shimmering distance. A cry of relief passed my cracked lips as it came into focus. I knocked until my knuckles stung, cracked and bled on that fucking shed. There was no one there. There was no evidence of anyone being there. Not even a dirt road or indentions of tires worn into the desert. It was just a corrugated metal shed that had sprung up out of the desert. At noon, the sliver of shade on the side of the shed went away. I hung my head and started walking again. More hours. More nothing. The sun was settling onto the horizon. Suddenly, screams pierced the evening air - some kind of horrible monster in the distance. My legs didn't respond when I commanded them to run. It was all I could do to turn and shuffle away from the screams. The sound was loud and inhuman. I looked back and saw dust being kicked up in a cloud headed straight for me. A growling, snarling noise joined the ear-splitting screams. Then, nothing. I looked back to see a great white beast crouched and ready to pounce, the dust settling around it. I stumbled and fell onto my back. And for a moment I admired the reds and oranges of the sunset. A Tequila Sunrise spilt over the vast open canvas of the sky. Onto that canvas, a woman's head and shoulders appeared. In the low light, her skin appeared blue. Her face held a look of blank, serious determination. The same look that had been melted onto my face. A fellow wanderer. I felt calm. Then after a small movement, she held a knife, and all calm that I had felt was replaced with animal fear. The realization that the beast was still there, a few yards behind her, and that she was somehow a part of that beast. A monster to be feared. There to end my long march at last. She didn't end me there in the desert under that fiery sunset. Instead, she brought me back into the world that I sought to escape; brought me here to the hospital in the belly of what a fevered mind saw as a great white beast. Who is she? She is the one who saved me.",

Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake \"Hollywood\" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell.",

    "input_text": "I can't take it anymore, how do you guys do it? I can't fucking take it anymore. I can't take this wage slave society in America. If they think I'm going to be a wage slave my entire life, they've got another thing coming. I'd rather kill myself. In fact, that's another reason added to the list. I can't fucking take it anymore. As you can tell, I'm severely depressed and have one foot out the door already. How do you guys handle being wage slaves? Or, if you're not, how did you avoid it? Thinking of only living my life just to survive sounds God awful, I can't take it anymore.",

There's all these things that I want to do but I can't concentrate long enough to achieve my goal. I never developed a work ethic in my childhood and wondered if you have any tips for doing so?",
